## Core Class Features

### Conquered Curse
Through unfortunate circumstances, you were stricken with a curse that should have broken you. However, whether by sheer willpower, introspective meditation, or arcane study, you not only overcame the worst of the challenges your curse presented, but learned to harness its power. 

Choose the curse you conquered: **Curse of Animation**, **Curse of the Armament**, **Curse of Combustion**, **Curse of the Created**, **Curse of Immortality**, **Curse of Misfortune**, **Curse of Mummification**, **Curse of Petrification**, or **Curse of Somnolence**. 

Your curse has become an integral part of you. The *remove curse* spell, as well as any similar effect, has no effect on your curse when it is cast on you.

#### Curse Ability & Curse Save DC
Choose **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, or **Charisma** as your curse ability:
- **Intelligence** if you scoured the multiverse for secrets through rituals or magical practices
- **Wisdom** if you used introspective meditation to harmonize with your curse
- **Charisma** if you conquered your curse through sheer force of will or bargaining

**Curse save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your curse ability modifier

#### Ailments
Each curse has ailments caused by its lingering effects. They are inconvenient, and occasionally dangerous, detriments to which you are always subject.

### Jinx
As an action, you can attempt to bestow a minor curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become subject to your choice of one of the following jinxes until the end of your next turn:
- The target has disadvantage on the next ability check it makes
- The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against a creature of your choice that you can see

You can maintain the effect on subsequent turns using your action, but the jinx ends once the target makes the associated type of roll, if you are more than 90 feet from the target, or if *dispel magic*, *greater restoration*, or *remove curse* is cast on the target.

### Malediction Metamorphosis (2nd Level)
Your curse begins evolving within you, changed by your manipulation of its purpose. You gain one malediction metamorphosis of your choice from the metamorphosis trees. When you reach certain accursed levels, you gain additional metamorphoses as shown in the table.

### Spellcasting (2nd Level)
You learn to use your curse's vile magicks to fuel the casting of spells. You are a half-caster, using your curse ability as your spellcasting ability.

#### Curse Spells
Each Conquered Curse has a list of spells that you learn automatically at certain levels. These don't count against your spells known.

### Ailment Control (2nd Level)
You can use spell slots to exert control over your curse's ailments:

- **Afflict:** As an action, expend a spell slot to force a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of your ailments for the duration.
- **Suppress:** As a bonus action, expend a spell slot to ignore your chosen ailments for the duration.

The duration depends on the spell slot level: 1 minute (1st), 10 minutes (2nd), 1 hour (3rd), 8 hours (4th), or 24 hours (5th+).

### Jealous Blight (3rd Level)
Your curse possessively guards you from others of its ilk. When you touch or attune to a cursed object other than your curse, the object's curse doesn't affect you.

- **7th Level:** You are immune to curse effects other than your curse, and your hit point maximum and ability scores can't be reduced against your will.
- **14th Level:** A magical effect other than your curse can't age you, possess you, put you to sleep, or transform you against your will.
- **20th Level:** A magical effect other than your curse can't impose disadvantage on any roll you make.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Malediction Versatility (4th Level)
Whenever you reach a level that grants Ability Score Improvement, you can replace one metamorphosis with a different one for which you qualify.
