## üé≠ **College of Broodsong**

_‚ÄúThe womb is a stage. Life is a performance. Death is the encore.‚Äù_

Bards of the College of Broodsong view creation as their ultimate expression‚Äînot through song or poetry alone, but through the birth of living, temporary beings from their own bodies. These bizarre, magical offspring are conjured through melodies so potent they reshape flesh and will.

Some see them as divine womb-priests. Others call them freakish and unnatural. But none deny the power of a bard who can sing life into the world‚Äîand then send it to die in their name.

### **Level 3 ‚Äì Broodbirth**

You can use your Bardic Inspiration to give birth to a magical, short-lived homunculus known as a **Broodling**.

**As a bonus action**, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to summon a Broodling, which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you.

**The Broodling**:

- Uses the **stat block of a Homunculus Servant** (Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron of Everything, pg. 118), but with the **following changes**:
    
    - It lasts for **1 minute** or until reduced to 0 HP.
        
    - It acts immediately after you in initiative.
        
    - When it dies, it **explodes**, dealing force damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die to all creatures within 5 feet (Dex save, DC = your Spell Save DC, for half).
        

You may only have **one Broodling** at a time. At 10th level, you can have two.

### **Level 3 ‚Äì Fertile Freakshow**

You learn the _Find Familiar_ spell and it counts as a Bard spell for you. You may cast it without material components, and the familiar always takes on a weird, half-born form‚Äîoozing, twitching, chirping in song.

Additionally, when you cast a Bard spell that summons or creates a creature (_Unseen Servant_, _Animate Objects_, _Summon Beast_, etc.), that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Bard level.

### **Level 6 ‚Äì Mass Contraction**

You've learned to birth in batches.

As an action, you may expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to give birth to a **litter of Broodlings** (one per spell level). These Broodlings function as above, but they:

- Act as a swarm (one initiative),
    
- Share one HP pool equal to 8 √ó the spell slot level,
    
- Use Pack Tactics and deal damage equal to **your Bardic Inspiration die + your CHA modifier** on a hit.
    

You may use this ability **once per long rest**, or again by expending another Bardic Inspiration die and spell slot.

### **Level 14 ‚Äì Mother of Monstrosity**

Your body becomes a walking womb of arcane abominations.

As an action, you can create a **Brood Titan**, a large, misshapen child of magic and madness. Choose one creature type: Aberration, Celestial, Construct, Fey, or Fiend. The Brood Titan reflects that theme.

The Brood Titan has the following properties:

- Large size, AC 16, HP = 60, Speed 30 ft.
    
- STR 18, DEX 14, CON 16, INT 4, WIS 10, CHA 6
    
- Multiattack: 2 Slam attacks, each dealing 2d8 + 4 force damage
    
- Death Burst: On death, explodes in a 15 ft radius for 6d6 damage of a type related to its origin (e.g., psychic for aberration, radiant for celestial, etc.)‚ÄîDex save for half.
    

It remains for 10 minutes or until destroyed. You can summon it **once per long rest**.

### Optional Quirks (for roleplay)

When you take this subclass, roll or choose:

1. You constantly hum lullabies in a forgotten language.
    
2. Your belly visibly swells each time you use Bardic Inspiration.
    
3. Your "children" whisper your name as they dissolve into goo.
    
4. Your voice has an unnatural echo, like you're never alone.
    
5. You keep little teeth or bones as trophies of your summons.
    
6. You insist each summoned creature has a name and birthday.

## Summary:

**College of Broodsong** is perfect for weird, visceral, summoner-style bards who treat _the act of birthing as performance_. It's both grotesque and poetic‚Äîoffering a blend of **creature summoning, flavor-heavy weirdness**, and mechanical support for ‚Äúgiving life that is destined to die.‚Äù
