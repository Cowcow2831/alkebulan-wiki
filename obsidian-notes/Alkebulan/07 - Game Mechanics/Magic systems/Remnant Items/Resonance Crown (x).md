# The Resonance Crown
*Wondrous item (headpiece), rare (requires attunement)*

## Physical Description
This crystalline circlet appears to be grown rather than crafted, formed from translucent blue-green crystal that resonates with a barely audible harmonic tone. Seven smaller crystal nodes rise from the band, each pulsing with its own rhythm and color. When worn, the crown sits weightlessly on the bearer's head, and the crystals' glow reflects in their eyes. Occasionally, geometric patterns of light play across the crystal surface, suggesting hidden mathematical relationships that the mind struggles to comprehend.

## Properties

### Enhancement Functions *(No surge required)*
- While wearing this crown, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened
- You can speak, read, and understand all languages while attuned to this item
- Your maximum number of spells known or prepared increases by 2 (if you are a spellcaster)

### Spell-Like Function - Mental Fortification *(Triggers Remnant Surge)*
Three times per day, you can activate the crown's protective harmonics as a reaction when you or an ally within 30 feet is targeted by a spell or magical effect that targets the mind (charm, fear, psychic damage, etc.). The target gains advantage on the saving throw and resistance to psychic damage from that effect. When you use this ability, roll on the Remnant Surge table.

### Hidden Function - Resonance Cascade *(Triggers Major Remnant Surge)*
Once per day, you can create a wave of harmonious energy that affects all creatures within a 30-foot radius. Allies gain the benefits of the *bless* spell for 1 minute (no concentration required), while enemies must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). Those who fail are stunned for 1 round as the conflicting harmonics overwhelm their minds. When you use this ability, roll on the Major Remnant Surge table.

**Discovery Method**: This function unlocks when the crown is worn during a moment of perfect harmony between party members, or when exposed to powerful enchantment magic while multiple allies are within its range.

## Quirks and Personality
- The crown hums different melodies based on the wearer's emotional state
- Crystals flicker when lies are spoken in the wearer's presence
- Occasionally projects brief telepathic images to nearby allies during moments of danger
- Resonates audibly with other crystal-based magic items within 60 feet
- The harmonic tone changes pitch based on the magical "health" of the surrounding area

## Lore and Background
Originally created by Solarian harmony-mages who sought to create perfect understanding between minds, this crown was part of a set designed for diplomatic councils. The resonance crystals were tuned to specific emotional and intellectual frequencies, allowing wearers to achieve unprecedented empathy and communication. When the Cataclysm shattered the harmonic networks that connected these items, this crown became a fragment of that lost unity, still seeking to create harmony in a broken world.
