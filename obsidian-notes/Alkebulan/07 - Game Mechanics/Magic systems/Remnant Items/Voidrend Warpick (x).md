# Voidrend Warpick
*Weapon (war pick), rare (requires attunement)*

## Physical Description
This brutal weapon appears to be forged from meteoric metal twisted by dimensional forces. The pick's head is a jagged crescent of midnight-black metal shot through with veins of pulsing purple energy that seem to writhe beneath the surface. The wooden handle is wrapped in leather that feels unnaturally cold to the touch, and whispered words in the Umbral tongue occasionally echo from the weapon when it strikes. Reality seems to bend slightly around the weapon's edge, creating an unsettling visual distortion.

## Properties

### Enhancement Functions *(No surge required)*
- This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
- You have resistance to necrotic damage while attuned to this weapon
- The weapon sheds dim purple light in a 5-foot radius

### Spell-Like Function - Dimensional Rend *(Triggers Remnant Surge)*
Three times per day, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to tear a small rift in space. The target takes an additional 2d6 force damage as reality buckles around the wound. Additionally, you can immediately use a bonus action to teleport to any unoccupied space within 15 feet of the target. When you use this ability, roll on the Remnant Surge table.

### Hidden Function - Void Strike *(Triggers Major Remnant Surge)*
Once per day, you can declare a Void Strike before making an attack roll. If the attack hits, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, the target is briefly pulled into the void between dimensions, becoming incapacitated until the end of their next turn and taking 3d8 necrotic damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not incapacitated. When you use this ability, roll on the Major Remnant Surge table.

**Discovery Method**: This function unlocks when the weapon has been used to kill a creature from another plane, or when exposed to planar magic during combat.

## Quirks and Personality
- The weapon grows heavier when its wielder acts with mercy or compassion
- Whispers tactical advice in battle, but always suggests the most violent solution
- Creates small tears in fabric, leather, and other materials it touches outside of combat
- Becomes restless and emanates cold when not used in combat for more than a week

## Lore and Background
Forged by Umbral weaponsmiths who sought to create implements that could literally cut through the barriers between dimensions, this warpick was designed for elite dimensional raiders. During the Cataclysm, many of these weapons were lost when their wielders were trapped between collapsing realities. This particular weapon bears the soul-marks of at least three previous owners, each of whom met violent ends.
