# The Prism of Echoes
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

## Physical Description
A small, multifaceted crystal prism about the size of a child's fist, carved from what appears to be crystallized time itself. Its surface shimmers with an inner light that pulses gently, and when held up to the eye, faint images of past events can be seen swirling within like smoke trapped in amber. The crystal bears hairline fractures that seem to move when not directly observedâ€”remnants of the reality-shattering forces that created it during the Cataclysm.

## Properties

### Enhancement Function - Divination Boost *(No surge required)*
Once per day, you can use the Prism to gain advantage on a single Arcana, History, or Investigation check related to uncovering information about the past or magical phenomena. The prism grows warm in your hand and the internal images become clearer, offering glimpses of relevant knowledge.

### Spell-Like Function - Echoed Spell *(Triggers Remnant Surge)*
Once per day, when a spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within 30 feet of the Prism, you can use your reaction to have the Prism store an "echo" of that spell. The stored spell can be released as an action on a subsequent turn (within 24 hours), replicating the original spell's effects exactly, using the original caster's spell save DC and spell attack bonus. When you use this ability, roll on the Remnant Surge table.

## Quirks and Personality
- The Prism occasionally whispers cryptic messages in long-dead languages to its bearer
- Shows brief visions of past events that occurred in the current location
- Grows noticeably colder when near sources of deception or illusion magic
- Sometimes reflects images of the bearer's own past instead of external events

## Lore and Background
Created by Solarian empire chronographers to record important historical events, this prism was caught in a temporal flux during the Cataclysm. It now exists partially outside normal time, allowing it to capture and replay magical energies. The Remnant Keepers believe dozens of these were created, but most were shattered when time itself broke during the great disaster.
