# Remnant Item Design System

## Core Philosophy

Remnant items are artifacts of immense power created before or during the Cataclysm that shattered the world. Unlike traditional magic items, they represent the unstable fusion of ancient magical knowledge with the chaotic energies that broke reality itself. Every Remnant item should feel like holding a piece of historyâ€”powerful, dangerous, and unpredictable.

## Design Principles

### 1. Multiple Layers of Function
- **Primary Function**: The main, most reliable ability (like a +1 weapon or spell effect)
- **Secondary Function**: A more powerful but limited ability 
- **Hidden Function**: Abilities that reveal themselves over time or under specific conditions
- **Quirk**: Unique behavioral traits that add personality and world flavor

### 2. Inherent Instability
- **Mandatory Risk**: Every use of Remnant powers triggers some form of randomness
- **Escalating Danger**: More powerful effects carry greater risks
- **Double-Edged Nature**: Great power comes with meaningful consequences

### 3. Living History
- **Memories**: Items occasionally show visions or whisper secrets from the past
- **Growth**: Items can evolve as characters level or discover their history
- **Faction Interest**: Remnant Keepers and other groups actively seek these items

## Rarity Guidelines

### Uncommon Remnant Items (500-1,000 gp)
- **Power Level**: 1-2 spell effects of 1st-2nd level, once per day each
- **Risk Level**: Minor inconveniences or temporary setbacks
- **Complexity**: 2-3 functions total
- **Examples**: Prism of Echoes, Tidecaller's Conch

### Rare Remnant Items (2,000-5,000 gp)
- **Power Level**: 2-3 spell effects of 2nd-4th level, limited uses per day
- **Risk Level**: Moderate consequences, temporary debuffs
- **Complexity**: 3-4 functions including hidden abilities
- **Examples**: Crystalweave Cloak, enhanced weapons with spell effects

### Very Rare Remnant Items (8,000-20,000 gp)
- **Power Level**: 3-4 spell effects of 3rd-6th level, some at-will abilities
- **Risk Level**: Serious consequences, temporary curses
- **Complexity**: 4-5 functions with significant hidden powers
- **Examples**: Echo Stone, Chronomancer's Hourglass

### Legendary Remnant Items (50,000+ gp)
- **Power Level**: 4-6 spell effects of 4th-9th level, multiple at-will abilities
- **Risk Level**: Potentially campaign-altering consequences
- **Complexity**: 5-7 functions with major hidden powers and personality
- **Examples**: Nexus Shards, Empire-era superweapons

## Remnant Surge System

### When to Trigger Surges
- **Enhancement Effects**: Passive bonuses, advantage/disadvantage, skill bonuses - NO surge
- **Spell-Like Effects**: Any function that replicates a spell or creates magical phenomena - ALWAYS surge
- **Optional Enhancement**: Players can choose to trigger a surge when using enhancement effects for additional benefits
- **Forced**: When the item takes damage or is exposed to other Remnant magic
- **Escalation**: Multiple surges in a short time increase severity via Fatigue system

### Surge Types by Item Rarity

**Uncommon Items**: Roll on Minor Remnant Surge Table (d12) 
- 1-4: Harmless but noticeable effects
- 5-8: Minor beneficial effects
- 9-12: Minor negative effects

**Rare Items**: Roll on Standard Surge Table (d20)
- 1-6: Negative effects (temporary debuffs, minor damage)
- 7-10: Neutral effects (cosmetic, environmental)
- 11-16: Positive effects (temporary buffs, bonus actions)
- 17-20: Major effects (significant buffs or significant risks)

**Very Rare/Legendary Items**: Roll on Major Surge Table (d20 + modifiers)
- Include effects from lower tables plus:
- Temporary transformations
- Reality distortions
- Planar effects
- Permanent changes (rare)

## Item Creation Template

### Basic Information
```
Name: [Name relating to function or origin]
Type: [Weapon, Armor, Wondrous Item, etc.]
Rarity: [Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare/Legendary]
Requires Attunement: [Yes/No - most Remnant items require attunement]
```

### Physical Description
- **Appearance**: Distinctive visual elements showing Cataclysm influence
- **Materials**: Unusual substances, crystalline elements, energy patterns
- **Size/Weight**: Usually normal for the item type
- **Condition**: Signs of age, battle damage, or magical alteration

### Primary Function
- **Always Active** or **Reliable Usage**: The item's most basic magical property
- **Game Mechanics**: Clear 5e mechanical benefit
- **No Surge Required**: This function works without triggering instability

### Secondary Function(s)
- **Limited Usage**: Typically 1-3 times per day/rest
- **Moderate Power**: 2nd-4th level spell equivalent
- **Surge Trigger**: Always requires Remnant Surge roll
- **Scaling**: May improve with character level or story progression

### Hidden Function(s)
- **Discovery Method**: How players learn about this ability
- **Powerful Effect**: Often equivalent to high-level spells
- **High Risk**: Major Surge roll or automatic negative consequence
- **Story Integration**: Tied to item's history or character development

### Quirks and Personality
- **Behavioral Traits**: How the item acts when not being used
- **Communication**: Whispers, visions, emotional impressions
- **Preferences**: Situations or users the item favors/dislikes
- **Historical Echoes**: Memories or knowledge from its past

### Remnant Surge Effects
- **Trigger Conditions**: When surges occur for this specific item
- **Custom Table**: Unique effects thematically appropriate to the item
- **Escalation Rules**: What happens with repeated surges
- **Mitigation**: Ways to reduce or avoid surge effects

### Lore and Background
- **Origin**: Pre-Cataclysm empire (Solarian/Umbral) or Cataclysm itself
- **Previous Owners**: Notable historical figures or events
- **Current Significance**: Why various factions want this item
- **Plot Hooks**: Adventure opportunities the item creates

### Faction Interest
- **Remnant Keepers**: Why they want to study/secure it
- **Amunrai Imperium**: Military or political value
- **Criminal Organizations**: Black market value or practical use
- **Academic/Religious**: Research or theological significance

## Sample Creation Process

### Step 1: Concept and Theme
Choose a core theme that reflects both power and instability:
- Time manipulation (chronomancy)
- Elemental fusion (multiple elements in one item)
- Reality alteration (space/dimension effects)
- Life/death boundary (necromantic healing)
- Memory/knowledge (information from the past)

### Step 2: Determine Rarity and Power Budget
- **Uncommon**: 2-3 functions, 1st-2nd level spell effects
- **Rare**: 3-4 functions, 2nd-4th level spell effects  
- **Very Rare**: 4-5 functions, 3rd-6th level spell effects
- **Legendary**: 5+ functions, 4th-9th level spell effects

### Step 3: Design Function Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Reliable, always-on benefit (resistance, bonus, minor spell)
2. **Secondary**: Limited daily use, moderate power, triggers surge
3. **Hidden**: Discovered through play, high power, major risk
4. **Quirk**: Personality trait that creates roleplay opportunities

### Step 4: Create Surge Table
Design 8-12 effects that fit the item's theme:
- 30% beneficial (temporary buffs, bonus actions, healing)
- 40% neutral/cosmetic (visual effects, environmental changes)
- 30% negative (temporary debuffs, minor damage, complications)

### Step 5: Develop Lore Integration
- Which pre-Cataclysm empire created it?
- What was its original purpose?
- How did it survive the Cataclysm?
- Why do current factions want it?

## Balance Considerations

### Power vs. Risk
- More powerful effects require greater risks
- Players should feel the tension between using powerful abilities and accepting consequences
- No effect should be purely beneficial without some element of uncertainty

### Scaling and Growth
- Items can unlock new functions as characters level
- Hidden abilities reveal through specific story events
- Some functions become more reliable with attunement time
- Surge effects can become less severe as characters learn to control the item

### Campaign Integration
- Every Remnant item should create at least one adventure hook
- Multiple factions should have legitimate interest in the item
- The item's history should tie into larger world events
- Player choices about the item should have meaningful consequences
