## Special Desert Effects

### Spectral Whisp Interaction
When you roll 11-12, 27-28, or 35-36, any Spectral Whisps within 120 feet are drawn to you and become friendly for the duration of the effect.

### Crystal Cacti Resonance
While affected by crystal-related surge effects (04, 07-08, 15-16, 25-26, 31-32, 45-46, 47-48, 61-62, 67-68, 69-70, 77-78, 87-88, 97-98, 99), you can sense Crystal Cacti within 1 mile.

### Memory Echoes
Effects that reference the past (35-36, 37-38, 55-56, 65-66, 100) may trigger visions relevant to the current location or situation, providing potential clues or lore.

## Adventure-Specific Triggers

### Near the Prism of Echoes
- **Within 30 feet:** Roll surge on any spell cast
- **Touching the Prism:** Automatic surge roll
- **Using Prism's abilities:** Surge roll required

### Crystal Garden Zones
- **Outer Ring:** Surge on critical magical failures only
- **Middle Ring:** Surge on spells of 2nd level or higher
- **Inner Sanctum:** Surge on any magical effect, including magical item use

### Crystallized Figures
- **Speak with Dead:** 25% chance of surge (roll d4, surge on 1)
- **Attempting to break crystallization:** Automatic surge
- **Magical healing attempts:** 50% chance of surge

## DM Notes

### Positive Effect Guidelines
- Crystal formations should feel protective and empowering
- Desert-themed benefits connect players to the environment
- Ancient whispers can provide useful information or atmosphere

### Negative Effect Guidelines
- Effects should create challenges, not end encounters
- Crystal/sand descriptions reinforce the alien nature of the wastes
- Temporary debuffs allow for creative problem-solving

### Cosmetic Effects
- Permanent changes should be minor and potentially beneficial
- Sand/crystal themes reinforce the setting
- Can provide ongoing roleplay opportunities

### Balancing Multiple Surges
If multiple characters trigger surges in one encounter:
- Roll separately for each character
- Consider environmental interactions between effects
- Crystal-based effects might resonate or interfere with each other
- Use the chaos to create memorable moments rather than bogging down combat
