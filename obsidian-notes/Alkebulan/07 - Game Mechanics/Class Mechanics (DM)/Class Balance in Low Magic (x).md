# Class Balance in Low Magic - Alkebulan

## Core Philosophy

Rather than modifying the mechanical balance of D&D 5e classes, Alkebulan achieves its low-magic feel through narrative context, social dynamics, and the rarity of certain class types. All classes function mechanically as written in the Player's Handbook, but their place in the world creates the authentic post-Cataclysm atmosphere.
