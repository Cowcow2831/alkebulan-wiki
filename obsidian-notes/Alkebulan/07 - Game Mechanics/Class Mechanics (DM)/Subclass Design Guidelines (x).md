# Subclass Design Guidelines

## Core Design Philosophy

Subclasses in Alkebulan should reflect the unique cultural, magical, and environmental aspects of the post-Cataclysm world while maintaining mechanical balance with official D&D 5e subclasses. They serve to deepen immersion and provide character options that feel authentically connected to the setting.

## Design Principles

### Thematic Integration

**World Connection**: Every subclass should tie directly to Alkebulan's history, geography, or cultures 
**Post-Cataclysm Relevance**: Abilities should reflect adaptation to the changed magical landscape 
**Cultural Authenticity**: Draw from the diverse cultures and traditions across the continent 
**Environmental Adaptation**: Reflect the unique challenges of different regions

### Mechanical Balance

**Power Level Parity**: Match the strength of official subclasses at equivalent levels 
**Feature Frequency**: Follow standard subclass progression (levels 3, 6, 10, 14, etc.) 
**Resource Management**: Use existing resource systems (spell slots, uses per rest, etc.) 
**Niche Protection**: Don't overshadow existing subclasses' unique roles

### Narrative Depth

**Story Hooks**: Provide built-in adventure opportunities and character development 
**Social Dynamics**: Consider how subclass choice affects NPC interactions 
**Regional Variations**: Allow for different manifestations across Alkebulan 
**Growth Potential**: Enable character evolution throughout campaign progression

## Subclass Categories

### Remnant-Touched Subclasses

**Theme**: Characters affected by or specialized in dealing with Remnant magic 
**Common Features**:
- Abilities that interact with magical anomalies
- Risk/reward mechanics involving magical corruption
- Enhanced magical sensitivity or resistance
- Unique ways of channeling unstable magical energy

**Design Considerations**:
- Balance power with potential drawbacks
- Provide both utility and combat applications
- Consider social consequences of visible Remnant exposure
- Include options for managing or hiding mutations

### Cultural Heritage Subclasses

**Theme**: Traditions preserved from pre-Cataclysm cultures or developed in response to new challenges 
**Common Features**:
- Abilities reflecting specific cultural practices
- Enhanced effectiveness in particular regions or situations
- Social benefits within associated communities
- Techniques passed down through oral tradition

**Design Considerations**:
- Respect cultural inspirations without stereotyping
- Provide benefits that scale throughout the character's career
- Include both mechanical and social advantages
- Allow for personal interpretation and adaptation

### Environmental Adaptation Subclasses

**Theme**: Specialization in surviving and thriving in Alkebulan's diverse and dangerous environments 
**Common Features**:

- Environmental hazard resistance or immunity
- Unique movement or survival capabilities
- Interaction with regional flora, fauna, or phenomena

**Design Considerations**:
- Ensure utility beyond specific environments
- Provide scalable benefits as characters advance
- Include both passive and active abilities
- Consider interaction with existing spells and features

### Professional Specialization Subclasses

**Theme**: Occupations and roles specific to post-Cataclysm society 
**Common Features**:
- Tool proficiencies and expertise
- Social benefits within professional communities
- Specialized knowledge about specific subjects
- Practical abilities for daily life and adventure

**Design Considerations**:
- Make professionally themed abilities adventuring-relevant
- Provide clear progression paths
- Include both individual and party benefits
- Avoid overly narrow focus that limits utility

## Feature Design Guidelines

### Level 3 Features (Defining Identity)

**Scope**: Establish the subclass's core theme and primary mechanical identity 
**Power Level**: Significant but not overwhelming - should feel impactful without overshadowing base class 
**Examples**:
- Bonus proficiencies related to theme
- 1-3 uses per short/long rest of signature ability
- Passive bonuses that apply frequently
- Access to expanded spell lists or unique cantrips

**Alkebulan-Specific Considerations**:
- How does this reflect post-Cataclysm adaptation?
- What cultural or environmental factors shaped this tradition?
- How does this interact with Remnant magic or lack thereof?

### Level 6 Features (Expanded Capability)

**Scope**: Build on level 3 foundation with complementary abilities 
**Power Level**: Moderate enhancement that adds versatility or power 
**Examples**:
- Enhanced versions of earlier abilities
- New applications of existing features
- Resistance or immunity to specific effects
- Utility abilities that solve common problems

**Design Focus**:
- Address weaknesses revealed in early play
- Provide new tactical options
- Enhance the subclass's unique role in the party
- Maintain thematic consistency while expanding scope

### Level 10 Features (Mastery Expression)

**Scope**: Demonstrate advanced mastery of the subclass's concepts 
**Power Level**: Significant upgrade that feels like a major milestone 
**Examples**:
- Powerful once-per-rest abilities
- Permanent upgrades to existing features
- Access to higher-level spell-like effects
- Unique interaction with core class features

**Alkebulan Integration**:
- Show how character has adapted to continental challenges
- Reflect deep understanding of post-Cataclysm realities
- Provide options for dealing with higher-level threats
- Demonstrate mastery over subclass's thematic elements

### Level 14 Features (Legendary Capability)

**Scope**: Capstone-level abilities that define masters of the tradition 
**Power Level**: Very powerful but not campaign-breaking 
**Examples**:
- Game-changing once-per-long-rest abilities
- Permanent character transformations
- Legendary resistance or similar defensive abilities
- Unique solutions to high-level challenges

**Design Philosophy**:
- Should feel appropriately epic for high-level play
- Provide unique solutions unavailable to other subclasses
