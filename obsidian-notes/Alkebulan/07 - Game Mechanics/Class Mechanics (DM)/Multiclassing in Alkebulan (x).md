# Multiclassing in Alkebulan

## Core Philosophy

Multiclassing in Alkebulan follows standard D&D 5e rules mechanically, but requires narrative justification that fits the world's post-Cataclysm reality. Every multiclass combination should tell a story about the character's journey, experiences, and how they've adapted to survive in this changed world.

## Narrative Requirements

### General Principles

**Story-Driven Progression**: Every level taken in a new class must be justified through in-game events, training, or character development.

**Cultural Context**: Multiclass combinations should make sense within Alkebulan's social structures and the character's background.

**Logical Progression**: The transition between classes should feel natural given the character's experiences and the world's dangers.

**Time and Training**: Learning new class abilities requires appropriate time investment and access to teachers or experiences.

## Common Multiclass Combinations

## Challenging Combinations

### Magic User/Magic User Multiclassing

**Wizard/Sorcerer - The Dual-Natured Caster** 
**Special Consideration**: Requires explanation for how someone with innate magic learned academic techniques, or vice versa 
**Possible Narratives**:
- Sorcerer whose wild magic forced them to seek scholarly control methods
- Wizard exposed to Remnant energy that awakened latent sorcerous abilities
- Character born with both natural talent and academic inclination

**Cleric/Warlock - The Conflicted Soul** 
**Social Danger**: Extremely risky combination in most of Alkebulan 
**Possible Narratives**:
- Desperate cleric who made a pact to save their community
- Warlock seeking redemption through divine service
- Character serving dual masters with conflicting goals

**Requirements**: Must address the moral and practical conflicts between divine and pact magic

### Outcast Class Combinations

**Wizard/Warlock - The Double Outcast** 
**Social Impact**: Would be hunted in most civilized areas 
**Narrative Requirements**: Must explain how character survives social persecution 
**Possible Stories**:
- Wizard whose experiments led to accidental pact formation
- Character using multiple magical sources to achieve specific goal
- Hiding true nature through careful deception and false identities

## Regional Considerations

### Port Zephyr

**Tolerance Level**: High - cosmopolitan city accepts diverse backgrounds 
**Common Combinations**:
- Merchant-focused multiclassing (any class + backgrounds involving trade)
- International influence allowing unusual training combinations
- Access to diverse teachers and learning opportunities

**Narrative Opportunities**:
- Character learned second class from foreign visitors
- Diverse population provides mentors for any reasonable combination
- Economic opportunities requiring diverse skill sets

### Amunrai Imperium

**Tolerance Level**: Structured - multiclassing must serve state interests 
**Approved Combinations**:
- Cleric/Paladin serving the Solar Pantheon
- Fighter/any class serving in imperial military
- Classes that support imperial expansion and control

**Restricted Combinations**:
- Any involving Wizard or Warlock without state approval
- Combinations that might threaten imperial authority

### Rural Areas

**Tolerance Level**: Practical - combinations must serve survival needs 
**Common Combinations**:
- Ranger/Fighter - protecting isolated communities
- Cleric/any class - spiritual leaders often wear multiple hats
- Druid/Ranger - natural area protection and guidance

**Rare Combinations**:
- Multiple magic classes - lack of teachers and social suspicion
- Urban-focused combinations - limited relevance to rural life

### Tribal Regions

**Tolerance Level**: Traditional - must fit within cultural frameworks 
**Accepted Combinations**:
- Barbarian/any class that maintains tribal values
- Druid/Ranger - respected nature-connected roles
- Classes that serve tribal protection and prosperity

**Cultural Requirements**:
- Training must come from within tribal traditions or honored exchanges
- Cannot violate cultural taboos or spiritual beliefs
- Must serve the tribe's needs and values

## Training and Development

### Time Requirements

**Gaining 1st Level in New Class**:
- Minimum 1-2 months of downtime for training
- Access to appropriate teacher or learning experience
- Character must meet ability score prerequisites

**Intensive Training**:
- Reduces time requirement but requires full dedication
- May involve dangerous or challenging experiences
- Could be part of active adventuring if circumstances align

**Self-Taught Development**:
- Requires books, artifacts, or natural ability (Sorcerer, Warlock)
- Takes longer but maintains character independence
- More likely to have unusual manifestations or quirks

### Teacher Requirements

**Finding Mentors**:
- NPCs must be willing to train the character
- Payment might be money, favors, or service
- Some teachers require proof of worthiness or shared values

**Alternative Learning**:
- Ancient texts or artifacts for Wizard levels
- Divine visions or calling for Cleric levels
- Exposure to natural forces for Druid or Sorcerer levels
- Pact formation for Warlock levels (dangerous!)

### Mechanical Integration

**Standard Rules Apply**: All D&D 5e multiclassing rules remain in effect 
**Ability Score Prerequisites**: Must be met as normal 
**Spell Slot Progression**: Follows standard multiclass spellcaster rules 
**Proficiency Restrictions**: Gain only the specified proficiencies for multiclassing

## Story Integration Guidelines

### Character Development Hooks

**Personal Growth**: Multiclassing reflects character evolution and new experiences 
**Crisis Response**: Learning new skills to handle unprecedented challenges 
**Opportunity**: Meeting the right teacher or discovering new abilities 
**Necessity**: Adapting to survive in dangerous situations

### Campaign Integration

**Downtime Activities**: Use training periods as campaign development time 
**Mentor NPCs**: Create interesting characters who can teach new classes 
**Story Arcs**: Build adventures around the search for training or teachers 
**Character Connections**: Use multiclass training to create bonds with NPCs and locations

### Social Consequences

**Reputation Changes**: New class levels might alter how NPCs react 
**Cultural Fit**: Some combinations enhance social standing, others create suspicion 
**Professional Opportunities**: New skills might open different career paths 
**Conflict Potential**: Some combinations create internal or external conflicts

## Player-DM Collaboration

### Planning Process

**Advance Discussion**: Players should discuss multiclass plans with DM 
**Story Development**: Work together to create compelling narratives 
**Timing Coordination**: Plan training periods during appropriate campaign moments 
**Consequence Awareness**: Understand social and story implications

### Ongoing Support

**Narrative Consistency**: Maintain character development throughout campaign 
**Mechanical Help**: Ensure players understand multiclass rules and interactions 
**Story Opportunities**: Create situations where multiclass abilities shine 
**Character Growth**: Allow multiclassing to enhance rather than complicate character concepts

## Red Flags and Restrictions

### Problematic Combinations

**Power Gaming Without Story**: Mechanical optimization without narrative justification 
**Contradictory Values**: Class combinations with inherently conflicting philosophies 
**Social Impossibility**: Combinations that would make survival in Alkebulan impossible 
**Teacher Availability**: Combinations requiring mentors that don't exist in the setting

### DM Oversight

**Veto Power**: DM can refuse multiclass combinations that don't fit the world 
**Story Requirements**: Can require specific narrative developments before allowing progression 
**Consequence Enforcement**: Should apply realistic social and practical consequences 
**Guidance Responsibility**: Help players create combinations that enhance rather than disrupt the campaign

The key to successful multiclassing in Alkebulan is ensuring that every mechanical choice serves the story and reflects the character's journey through this dangerous, post-Cataclysm world. When done well, multiclassing becomes a powerful tool for character development and world immersion.
