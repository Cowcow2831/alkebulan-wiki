Overarching Conflict:
The Amunrai Imperium is seeking to expand its power by recovering and controlling powerful artifacts from the pre-cataclysm era. The Remnant Keepers are working to prevent this concentration of power, believing it could lead to another disaster.

Initial Hook:
A seemingly minor incident in Port Zephyr involving a magical artifact sets off a chain of events that draws the players into this larger conflict.

Here's a potential storyline:

Excellent plan. Let's develop the beginning of the campaign, focusing on Port Zephyr and leading up to the "Echoes Beneath the Light" adventure. This will give your players time to establish their characters and get familiar with the setting before diving into the larger conflict.

Starting at Level 3 (Session 0):
- Introduce the players to Port Zephyr and its key locations.
- Have them establish their reasons for being in the city (jobs, personal quests, etc.).
- Provide a small introductory mission to get them working together (e.g., helping a merchant recover stolen goods, which introduces them to the city's underworld).

Level 3-4 Adventures in Port Zephyr:
1. "[[Lvl 3 The Mist Walker's Gambit (x)]]" (Level 3)
   - A Mist Walker agent attempts to steal a valuable artifact from a wealthy merchant.
   - Players can choose to help or hinder the theft, introducing them to the guild's presence in the city.

2. "Trouble in the Floating Gardens" (Level 3-4)
   - Strange magical growth is overtaking one of the Floating Gardens.
   - Players investigate, discovering it's caused by a fragment of a pre-cataclysm artifact.
   - This subtly introduces the theme of dangerous ancient magic.

3. "[[Lvl 4 Echoes Beneath the Light (x)]]"
   - The adventure you've already developed, exploring the temple beneath the Sapphire Lighthouse.
   - This further establishes the presence of ancient magic and hints at deeper mysteries.

Level 4-5 Transition:
1. "Whispers of the Wind" (Level 4-5)
   - Strange weather patterns and magical disturbances start occurring around Port Zephyr.
   - Players investigate, uncovering clues that point to activities outside the city.
   - This sets up their departure at Level 5.

Throughout these adventures, sprinkle in:
- Rumors about Amunrai Imperium expansion
- Subtle signs of Remnant Keeper activity
- Opportunities for players to develop connections with various factions in Port Zephyr

Side Quests and Downtime Activities:
- Jobs for the Port Authority or local merchants
- Exploration of Port Zephyr's unique districts
- Opportunities to learn about Alkebulan's history and cultures

As they reach Level 5:
- An event occurs that ties into one or more character backstories, prompting the group to leave Port Zephyr.
- This could be a lead on a personal quest, a job offer, or a plea for help from a contact outside the city.






2. Investigation and Choices (Levels 5-6):
   - The players are hired to investigate the origin of the artifact, leading them to discover a hidden cache of pre-cataclysm items.
   - They must choose whether to ally with the Remnant Keepers, work for the Amunrai Imperium, or try to navigate between the two.

3. Escalating Conflict (Levels 7-10):
   - Their actions draw them deeper into the conflict between the Imperium and the Remnant Keepers.
   - They uncover plans for a major Amunrai expedition to a rumored powerful artifact site.

4. Race Against Time (Levels 11-14):
   - The players must race against Amunrai forces to reach the artifact site, facing challenges from the environment, ancient guardians, and rival factions.

5. Final Confrontation (Levels 15-17):
   - At the artifact site, the players face a critical choice that will determine the balance of power in Alkebulan.
   - Their decision could reshape the political landscape and potentially unleash or prevent a magical catastrophe.

Throughout this campaign, you can weave in subplots involving other factions like the Mist Walkers, explore the unique cultures and environments of Alkebulan, and delve into the personal histories of the player characters.
