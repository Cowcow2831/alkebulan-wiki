# Welcome to Alkebulan

## A Player's Guide to the World

---

## **The World Today**

Three centuries ago, a catastrophic magical war known as **The Great Sundering** shattered two mighty empires and reshaped the continent of Alkebulan forever. The world you're about to enter is one of recovery, adaptation, and hidden dangers—where magic is scarce, ancient secrets lie buried, and new powers rise from the ashes of the old.

This is a **low-magic setting** where spellcasters are rare and often viewed with suspicion, making every magical ability precious and every ancient artifact a treasure worth fighting for.

## **Your Starting Location: Port Zephyr**

You begin your adventure in **Port Zephyr**, the crown jewel of the southern Cerulean Reach—a bustling trade city of 10,000 souls built into terraced hillsides overlooking a protected harbor. This cosmopolitan port serves as a melting pot where cultures from across Alkebulan converge to trade goods, stories, and opportunities.

### **The City's Districts**

- **Harbor Ward**: Bustling docks where ships and the occasional airship bring goods from across the continent
- **Merchant Quarter**: Grand bazaars and trading houses where fortunes are made and lost
- **Residential Terraces**: Terraced neighborhoods carved into the hillsides, from modest homes to comfortable middle-class residences
- **Hill Ward**: Exclusive district of wealthy merchant princes and the famous **Sapphire Lighthouse**

### **Notable Features**

- **The Sapphire Lighthouse**: A magical beacon that guides both ships and airships safely to port
- **The Floating Gardens**: Mysterious agricultural platforms that drift in the harbor, producing exotic crops
- **The Grand Bazaar**: A sprawling marketplace where anything can be bought—for the right price

## **The Major Powers**

### **The Amunrai Imperium** (The Northern Realm)

A powerful, expanding empire reminiscent of ancient Egypt, centered around sun worship and rigid hierarchy. They're actively expanding their influence southward, viewing Port Zephyr as a strategic prize. Their agents operate throughout the city, sometimes openly, sometimes in shadow.

- **Government**: Centralized monarchy with complex bureaucracy
- **Religion**: Solar Pantheon emphasizing order and divine rulership
- **Goals**: Continental expansion and recovery of ancient artifacts

### **The Remnant Keepers** (Secret Organization)

A shadowy network dedicated to preventing another catastrophe by controlling dangerous magical artifacts and knowledge. They work from the shadows, appearing wherever ancient magic or powerful artifacts surface.

- **Philosophy**: Balance and prevention of magical catastrophe
- **Methods**: Infiltration, selective sharing of knowledge, sabotage when necessary
- **Presence**: Hidden agents in governments and organizations across Alkebulan

### **The Mist Walkers** (Local Thieves' Guild)

Port Zephyr's organized criminal network that controls smuggling, information brokering, and various illicit activities. Despite their criminal nature, they serve an important role in the city's complex economy.

- **Specialties**: Smuggling, information gathering, "protection" services
- **Territory**: Strong presence in the Harbor District with connections throughout the city
- **Reputation**: Professional criminals who keep their word and maintain order in their sphere

## **Magic in Alkebulan**

Magic is **rare and distrusted** in this post-Cataclysm world. The Great Sundering demonstrated magic's destructive potential, leaving most people wary of spellcasters.

### **Types of Magic**

- **Traditional Magic**: Standard D&D spellcasting, but practitioners are few and often face social challenges
- **Remnant Magic**: Dangerous, unstable magical energy left over from the Cataclysm—powerful but risky
- **Divine Magic**: Generally more accepted than arcane magic, as it's seen as having moral foundation

### **Social Attitudes**

- **Clerics and Paladins**: Respected as moral guardians
- **Bards**: Valued as storytellers and preservers of culture
- **Wizards and Sorcerers**: Viewed with suspicion and sometimes fear
- **Warlocks**: Deeply distrusted due to their otherworldly pacts

---

## **Character Creation Guidelines**

### **All Standard D&D 5e Classes Are Available**

Every official class can find a place in Alkebulan, though some require more careful consideration of their social role and background.

### **Key Considerations**

- **Magic Users**: Consider how your character learned their abilities and how they handle social prejudice
- **Background Integration**: Think about how your background fits into the post-Cataclysm world
- **Regional Origins**: Characters can come from anywhere in Alkebulan, each region offering different cultural perspectives

---

## **Religions and Beliefs**

The spiritual landscape of Alkebulan is diverse, shaped by both ancient traditions and post-Cataclysm adaptations:

### **Major Faiths**

- **The Tide Callers**: Maritime deities popular in coastal regions like Port Zephyr
- **The Solar Pantheon**: Dominant in the Amunrai Imperium, emphasizing order and hierarchy
- **Spirit Weavers**: Animistic beliefs focusing on nature spirits and ancestral guides
- **The Equilibrium**: Philosophy-based religion popular among scholars, emphasizing balance

### **Post-Cataclysm Faiths**

- **The Cult of the Shattered Moon**: Believes in renewal through upheaval (viewed with suspicion)
- **The Way of Echoes**: Seeks wisdom from pre-Cataclysm civilizations
