# Content Warnings for Alkebulan

*A dark fantasy D&D campaign about environmental contamination, community resilience, and rebuilding civilization after magical catastrophe*

---

## Session Zero Requirements

<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
This campaign addresses mature themes inspired by real-world environmental disasters, labor rights, and post-conflict recovery. Before we begin, we'll have a detailed Session Zero discussion to establish boundaries and implement safety tools.

**Safety Tools We'll Use:**
- **X-Card System** - Stop content immediately without explanation
- **Regular Check-ins** - Start each session discussing comfort levels
- **Fade to Black** - Skip detailed descriptions when needed
- **Open Communication** - Adjust content based on group feedback

**Campaign Tone:** Dark but playable. Heroes matter and positive change is possible, but every victory requires sacrifice and difficult choices.
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_END -->

## Core Campaign Themes

<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
### Environmental Contamination
The world suffers from magical radiation ([[Remnant Magic]]) that causes progressive illness similar to radiation poisoning. This is the central environmental threat, not gratuitous body horror.

### Economic Inequality  
Communities struggle with resource scarcity, forcing difficult choices about survival versus safety. Wealthy areas have clean resources while poor areas face contamination exposure.

### Community Resilience
Despite hardship, communities support each other through mutual aid, cultural preservation, and collective action. Player characters are part of this rebuilding effort.

### Political Complexity
The expanding [[Amunrai Imperium]] and corrupt local authorities create difficult political situations requiring careful navigation and moral choices.

### Trauma and Recovery
Characters and communities deal with inherited trauma from the Cataclysm while building hope for the future. Focus is on healing and growth, not dwelling on suffering.
