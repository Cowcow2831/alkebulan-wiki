## Core Class Features

### Remnant Sense
Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to open your awareness to detect remnant magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any remnant magic within 30 feet of you that isn't behind total cover. This sense can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Channeling
At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel remnant energy. You have a number of channeling points equal to your Remnant Channeler level. You can spend these points to fuel various channeling abilities. You regain all spent channeling points when you finish a long rest.

Some of your channeling abilities require saving throws. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
**Channeling save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
