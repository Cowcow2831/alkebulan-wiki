Remnant Channelers who follow the Path of the Elementalist learn to harness the raw elemental forces within remnant magic. They understand that the cataclysm didn't just reshape the land - it fundamentally altered the elements themselves, infusing them with chaotic remnant energy that can be controlled by those with the knowledge and will to do so.

## Path of the Elementalist Features

### Elemental Affinity
*3rd-level Path of the Elementalist feature*

Choose two elements from the following list: Fire, Cold, Lightning, or Acid. You gain the following benefits:
- Your remnant abilities can deal damage of your chosen types instead of force damage.
- You gain resistance to your chosen damage types.
- You learn two elemental manifestations from the Elemental Manifestations list (see below).
- When you deal damage of one of your chosen types, you can add half your Remnant Channeler level (rounded down) to one damage roll.

### Elemental Mastery
*6th-level Path of the Elementalist feature*

Your control over elemental forces grows stronger:
- When you deal damage of your chosen types, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll.
- As a reaction when you take damage of one of your chosen types, you can absorb the energy. Reduce the damage by your Remnant Channeler level and gain one channeling point. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- You can create minor elemental effects at will, such as:
  - Light a small fire or extinguish flames within a 5-foot cube
  - Freeze or thaw a cubic foot of water
  - Create harmless lightning sparks
  - Neutralize small amounts of acid

### Fury of the Elements
*10th-level Path of the Elementalist feature*

Your elemental powers intensify:
- Choose a third element from the available options. You gain the same benefits as your original choices.
- Your elemental damage ignores resistance (but not immunity).
- As a bonus action, you can create an elemental aura in a 15-foot radius around you. Choose one of your known elements. Until the start of your next turn, creatures that start their turn in the aura or enter it for the first time take damage of the chosen type equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Avatar of the Elements
*14th-level Path of the Elementalist feature*

You achieve mastery over elemental forces:
- You gain immunity to your chosen elements.
- When you score a critical hit with an elemental ability, roll once on the Remnant Surge table.
- Once per long rest, you can use your action to transform into an elemental avatar for 1 minute. Choose one of your known elements. You gain the following benefits:
  - Your movement speed increases by 30 feet
  - You can hover
  - You are immune to the chosen damage type
  - Your attacks and abilities of the chosen element deal an extra 1d8 damage
  - You gain a special ability based on the chosen element (see Elemental Avatar Abilities below)
