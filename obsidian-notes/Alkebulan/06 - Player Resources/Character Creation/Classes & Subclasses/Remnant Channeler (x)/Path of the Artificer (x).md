Remnant Channelers who follow the Path of the Artificer study the remnants of ancient technology, learning to harness and replicate the powerful artifacts of the pre-cataclysm era. They combine technical expertise with an intuitive understanding of remnant magic to create and modify magical items.

## Path of the Artificer Features

### Artificer's Expertise
*3rd-level Path of the Artificer feature*

You gain the following benefits:
- You gain proficiency with medium armor and artisan's tools (tinker's tools).
- You can use artisan's tools as a spellcasting focus for your Remnant Channeler abilities.
- You learn two infusions from the Remnant Infusions list (see below).
- You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to identify magical items that contain remnant energy.

### Enhanced Attunement
*6th-level Path of the Artificer feature*

Your connection to magical items grows stronger:
- You can attune to one additional magic item beyond the normal limit of three.
- As an action, you can analyze a magic item you touch. You learn its properties, how to use them, and how many charges it has remaining, if any. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- Your infused items gain additional effects based on your Intelligence modifier. When you create an infusion, you can add your Intelligence modifier to any numerical bonus it provides (damage, AC, saving throws, etc.).

### Remnant Reconstruction
*10th-level Path of the Artificer feature*

You gain the ability to manipulate magical items:
- You can cast the *fabricate* spell once without expending channeling points. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
- When crafting magic items, you can substitute remnant energy for traditional components. For every 100 gp worth of components required, you can expend 2 channeling points instead.
- As an action, you can attempt to temporarily suppress a magical item's properties. If the item is being held or worn by a creature other than you, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Remnant Channeler spell save DC or have the item's magical properties suppressed for 1 minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Master Artificer
*14th-level Path of the Artificer feature*

You achieve mastery over magical items:
- Once per long rest, you can spend 10 minutes modifying a magic item to change one of its properties to another of equal rarity. This change lasts until your next long rest.
- Your infusions no longer end at the completion of a long rest. They remain active until you choose to end them or create new ones.
- As an action, you can absorb the power from a magic item, destroying it and regaining a number of channeling points equal to its rarity (Common = 2, Uncommon = 4, Rare = 6, Very Rare = 8, Legendary = 10).

## Remnant Infusions
When you learn infusions, choose from the following list:

### Enhanced Weapon
*Prerequisite: 3rd level*
You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until your infusion ends, that weapon becomes magical, gaining a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Remnant Shield

You touch a shield or piece of armor. Until your infusion ends, the item grants its wearer a +1 bonus to AC. Additionally, the wearer can use their reaction to gain resistance to one type of damage from a single attack.

### Force Generator

You touch a handheld object. Until your infusion ends, the wielder can cast *mage hand* at will and can use it to lift up to 20 pounds.

### Energy Storage
*Prerequisite: 3rd level*
You touch an object. Until your infusion ends, the object can store one spell of 1st or 2nd level that you cast into it. The stored spell can be released as a bonus action by anyone holding the object.

### Additional Infusions at Higher Levels

#### Gravity Manipulator
*Prerequisite: 9th level*
You touch an item of clothing. Until your infusion ends, the wearer can cast *levitate* once per day and has advantage on ability checks and saving throws against being moved against their will.

#### Phase Shifter

You touch a piece of jewelry. Until your infusion ends, the wearer can cast *misty step* twice per day and can use their reaction to become incorporeal until the start of their next turn.

You touch a spellcasting focus. Until your infusion ends, the wielder gains a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and can add their Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with spells.

#### Remnant Battery

You touch an object. Until your infusion ends, whenever the bearer takes damage, they can use their reaction to regain one channeling point. The item can store up to 3 channeling points at a time.

Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one infusion you know with another one that you could learn at that level.
