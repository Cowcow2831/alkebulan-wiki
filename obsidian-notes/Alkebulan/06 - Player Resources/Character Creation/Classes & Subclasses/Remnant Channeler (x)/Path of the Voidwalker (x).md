Remnant Channelers who follow the Path of the Voidwalker study the fabric of reality itself, learning to manipulate the spaces between spaces. They understand that the cataclysm didn't just reshape the physical world - it created tears in reality that can be exploited by those who understand their nature.

## Path of the Voidwalker Features

### Reality Bender
*3rd-level Path of the Voidwalker feature*

You gain the following benefits:
- You learn the *misty step* spell and can cast it by spending 2 channeling points.
- When you teleport, you leave behind a shadowy portal that lasts until the start of your next turn. One ally can use their reaction to step through this portal, teleporting to your destination.
- You have advantage on saving throws against being restrained or grappled.
- You learn two void techniques from the Void Techniques list (see below).

### Temporal Manipulation
*6th-level Path of the Voidwalker feature*

Your understanding of time deepens:
- As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll or saving throw, you can spend 2 channeling points to impose advantage or disadvantage on the roll.
- As an action, you can create a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 30 feet where time moves differently. Creatures in the sphere must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they move. This sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you lose concentration. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- You gain brief glimpses of possible futures. When you roll initiative, you can roll twice and take either result.

### Void Step
*10th-level Path of the Voidwalker feature*

Your mastery over space grows stronger:
- Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- You can move through other creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
- As a bonus action, you can spend 3 channeling points to create a temporal duplicate of yourself that lasts until the end of your next turn. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you and acts on your initiative count. It uses your statistics but can only take the Attack action. Any damage it deals is force damage.

### Master of Space and Time
*14th-level Path of the Voidwalker feature*

You achieve mastery over reality:
- Once per long rest, when you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can reroll with advantage.
- When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you can trigger a beneficial effect from the Remnant Surge table instead of suffering a critical failure.
- You can spend 5 channeling points to create a pocket dimension that lasts for 1 hour. This functions like Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion, except it's a 50-foot cube of empty space that can be accessed through a portal you create within 5 feet of you.

## Void Techniques
When you learn void techniques, choose from the following list:

### Space Techniques
- **Spatial Anchor**: As a bonus action, mark your current location. Until the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to teleport back to this location.
- **Reality Slice**: Spend 2 channeling points to make a melee attack that cuts through space itself. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 2d8 + your Intelligence modifier, and all creatures in a line between you and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or take half as much damage.

### Time Techniques
- **Temporal Shield**: As a reaction when you take damage, spend 2 channeling points to split the damage between your current self and a future version of you. Take half the damage now and half at the end of your next turn.
- **Time Skip**: Spend 3 channeling points as a bonus action to gain an additional action this turn. After using this technique, your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.

### Void Techniques
- **Void Step**: Spend 1 channeling point as a bonus action to become incorporeal until the start of your next turn. You can move through solid objects but must end your movement in an unoccupied space.
- **Gravity Well**: Spend 2 channeling points as an action to create a 15-foot radius sphere of altered gravity centered on a point you can see within 60 feet. Creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward the center and become restrained until the end of your next turn.

### Reality Techniques
- **Probability Shift**: When a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll or ability check, you can spend 1 channeling point as a reaction to force them to roll an additional d20 and use the lower result.
- **Phase Burst**: Spend 3 channeling points as an action to teleport up to 30 feet and force each creature within 10 feet of your arrival point to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.

## Advanced Techniques
*Available at 10th level*

### Master Space Techniques
- **Reality Anchor**: As an action, spend 4 channeling points to create a 20-foot radius zone where teleportation and planar travel are impossible for 1 minute.
- **Spatial Collapse**: Spend 5 channeling points as an action to force all creatures within 30 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw as space collapses in on itself. Creatures take 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one, and are pulled 15 feet toward you.

### Master Time Techniques
- **Temporal Loop**: When you would take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can spend 4 channeling points as a reaction to instead rewind time to the start of your last turn. You retain knowledge of what occurred.
- **Time Dilation**: Spend 5 channeling points as an action to target up to three creatures within 60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, their movement speed is halved, they make attack rolls with disadvantage, and they can take only an action or bonus action on their turn, not both.

These techniques represent your growing mastery over space and time, but they should be used carefully, as tampering with reality can have unpredictable consequences.
