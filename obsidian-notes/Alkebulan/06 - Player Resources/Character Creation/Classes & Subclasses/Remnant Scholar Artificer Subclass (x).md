Remnant Scholar Artificer

Level 3: Remnant Attunement
- You can attune to one additional magic item beyond the normal limit of three.
- You can use your Artificer's tools as a focus for Remnant Magic spells.
- You learn the Identify spell and can cast it as a ritual without material components when examining a Remnant artifact.
- You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill.

Level 3: Remnant Infusions
You gain access to special infusions that channel Remnant Magic:
1. Stabilizing Matrix: Apply to a Remnant artifact. The user has advantage on checks to avoid magical backlash when using the artifact.
2. Energy Siphon: Apply to a weapon. Once per turn, when you hit with this weapon, you can absorb Remnant energy. Gain 1d4 temporary hit points and deal an extra 1d4 force damage.
3. Remnant Amplifier: Apply to a spellcasting focus. Spells cast through this focus that deal damage add 1d4 force damage.
4. Restorative Resonator: Apply to a shield or armor. As a bonus action, the wearer can expend a charge to heal themselves or a creature they can touch for 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. This infusion has charges equal to your Intelligence modifier and regains all expended charges after a long rest.

Level 5: Remnant Analysis
- As an action, you can analyze a Remnant artifact or a location suffused with Remnant energy. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DM provides insight about its powers, dangers, or history based on the result.
- You have advantage on saving throws against magical effects produced by Remnant artifacts or Remnant-touched creatures.
- Once per short or long rest, you can use your reaction when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell to redirect it to another creature of your choice within 30 feet of you.

Level 5: Remnant-Infused Strike
- Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal an extra 2d8 force damage to the target, plus 1d8 for each level of the spell slot above 1st.
- If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this feature, you regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level (rounded up).

Level 9: Remnant Surge Control
- When you or an ally within 30 feet would be affected by a magical surge or backlash from Remnant Magic, you can use your reaction to attempt to control it. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against a DC set by the DM. On a success, you can choose the effect from the surge table or negate it entirely.
- On a successful control, you can store the surge energy. Your next damaging spell or Remnant-Infused Strike deals extra force damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
- You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) per long rest.

Level 15: Remnant Fusion
- You can spend 1 hour to temporarily fuse two Remnant artifacts into a single, more powerful item. The fused item retains the primary abilities of both original items and gains a new power determined by the DM.
- While wielding a fused item, you can cast Mass Cure Wounds once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
- The fusion lasts for 1 hour, after which the items separate and can't be fused again until after a long rest.
- You can use this feature once per long rest.
