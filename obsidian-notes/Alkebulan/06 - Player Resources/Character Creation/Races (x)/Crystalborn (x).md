Crystalborn Lore:

Origins:
Crystalborn are an exceptionally rare race that emerged in the aftermath of the great cataclysm. They are believed to be the result of humans exposed to intense concentrations of magical energy during the disaster, their bodies and spirits fundamentally altered by the raw arcane power that reshaped Alkebulan.

Nature:
Crystalborn have partially crystalline bodies, with growths of luminous crystal integrated into their flesh. These crystals pulse with inner light and respond to the Crystalborn's emotions and magical energies. Their minds are structured differently from other races, giving them unique perspectives and resilience against mental influences.

Rarity:
There are perhaps only a few hundred Crystalborn in all of Alkebulan. Their births are unpredictable, sometimes occurring to normal human parents in areas with high concentrations of residual magic. As such, many Crystalborn grow up isolated, unaware of others of their kind.

Society:
Due to their rarity, Crystalborn have no society of their own. Most live among other races, often the subject of fascination, fear, or reverence. Some seek out others of their kind, forming small, scattered communities. Others live solitary lives, pursuing knowledge or mastery over their unique abilities.

Cultural Traits:
- Deep curiosity about magic and the nature of reality
- Often struggle with relating to shorter-lived races
- Many feel a sense of purpose tied to understanding the cataclysm and its effects
- Tendency to approach problems from unusual angles due to their unique thought patterns

Relationship with Other Races:
Crystalborn are often viewed with a mix of awe and unease. Some see them as living magical artifacts or oracles, while others fear them as unnatural beings. Many Crystalborn find themselves the subject of unwanted attention or study.

Naming Conventions:
Crystalborn names often reflect light, crystal formations, or magical phenomena. Some adopt names from the cultures they grow up in, while others choose names that resonate with their crystalline nature.
