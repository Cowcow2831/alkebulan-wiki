## **Core PHB Races**

### **Humans** ✅
**Integration**: Perfect fit - the dominant survivors of the Cataclysm

**Lore**: Humans were the primary population of both pre-Cataclysm empires and have adapted to become the most widespread race in modern Alkebulan. Different human cultures developed distinct traditions based on their regional experiences during and after the Cataclysm.

**Regional Variants**:
- **Northern Humans**: Descendants of Solarian citizens, often with slight solar-touched features
- **Southern Humans**: Former Umbral territories, comfortable with shadows and twilight
- **Coastal Humans**: Maritime cultures that survived on islands and trade
- **Desert Humans**: Hardy survivors who adapted to the harsh post-Cataclysm wastelands

### **Elves** 🔄
**Integration**: Long-lived witnesses to the Cataclysm with deep cultural memory

**Lore Adaptation**: Elves were present during the Cataclysm and many still remember the old world. This has made them valuable historians but also left many with deep trauma. Elven communities often serve as keepers of pre-Cataclysm knowledge.

**Subrace Adaptations**:
- **High Elves**: Former Solarian court advisors, retain knowledge of solar magic and crystal technology
- **Wood Elves**: Guardians of the few surviving ancient forests, skilled at detecting remnant corruption in nature  
- **Dark Elves**: Descendants of Umbral nobility, comfortable with shadow magic and void-touched artifacts

**Lore Adaptation**: Dwarven clans weathered the Cataclysm in deep mountain halls and underground cities. They emerged as skilled artisans capable of working with remnant-touched materials and are highly valued for their ability to create stable magical items.

**Subrace Adaptations**:

**Cultural Role**: Often serve as merchants, innkeepers, diplomats, and community organizers who help diverse groups work together.

### **Dragonborn** 🔄
**Integration**: Rare and revered descendants of ancient draconic pacts

**Lore Adaptation**: Dragonborn trace their lineage to ancient dragons who made pacts with the pre-Cataclysm empires. The Cataclysm severed many of these connections, making dragonborn both rare and highly respected for their draconic heritage.

**Breath Weapon Adaptation**: *Optional Rule* - Dragonborn breath weapons may occasionally trigger minor remnant surges in areas of high magical residue (DM discretion).

**Social Standing**: Often found in leadership positions, as their draconic heritage is seen as a sign of strength and wisdom.

### **Gnomes** 🔄

**Lore**: In a world where physical prowess is often necessary for survival, half-orcs are valued members of most communities. Many serve as guards, laborers, or soldiers.

### **Tieflings** ⚙️
**Mechanical Change**: Replace fiendish heritage with **Umbral Connection**

**Lore Adaptation**: Tieflings in Alkebulan are descendants of humans exposed to concentrated umbral/void magic during the Cataclysm. Rather than fiendish ancestry, they carry the legacy of shadow and void energies from the Umbral Sovereignty.

**Mechanical Adjustment**:
- **Fiendish Resistance** becomes **Umbral Resistance** (cold damage instead of fire)
- **Hellish Rebuke** becomes **Shadow Rebuke** (same mechanics, cold/necrotic damage and shadow effects)
- **Darkness** spell remains appropriate (shadow magic)

**Social Standing**: Viewed with suspicion but not necessarily evil - more "touched by dangerous magic" than "cursed by fiends."

### **Kenku** 🔄
**Integration**: Messengers and information gatherers in the fragmented world

**Lore Adaptation**: Some Kenku believe their curse is connected to the Cataclysm - that they once served as messengers for the ancient empires but were silenced when the old world ended.

**Cultural Role**: Valued for their perfect memory and mimicry abilities, essential for preserving information in a world where written records are scarce.

### **Lizardfolk** ✅

**Mechanical Changes**: Keep all Fairy stats and abilities, but change thematic descriptions

**Lore Adaptation**: Remnant Sprites are tiny humanoids spontaneously created by chaotic remnant energies in areas of high magical concentration. They appear to be living crystallizations of wild magic, with translucent skin that shifts in color and small wings made of pure energy.

**Abilities Reskinned**:
- **Fairy Magic** → **Remnant Magic**: Same spells (*druidcraft*, *faerie fire*, *enlarge/reduce*) but powered by unstable magical energy
- **Flight** → **Energy Suspension**: Wings are manifestations of magical force rather than biological
- **Fey Passage** → **Phase Step**: Can briefly become incorporeal by destabilizing their magical form

### **Hobgoblins** 🔄

**Social Standing**: Viewed with suspicion due to their reptilian features, but not necessarily evil.

### **Grung** ❌

### **Shadar-kai** ⚙️
**Mechanical Adjustment**: Replace Shadowfell connection with **Umbral Touched**

### **Eladrin** ❌ → 🔄

## **Newer Releases & Specialized Content**

### **Autognomes** ❌ → ⚙️

**Integration**: Gliding traders and scouts

**Lore Adaptation**: Hadozee communities survived in forested areas and have become excellent scouts and messengers. Their gliding ability makes them valuable for reconnaissance and communication.

### **Gem Dragonborn** ⚙️
**Mechanical Adaptation**: Replace psionic abilities with **Crystal Resonance**

**Lore Adaptation**: These dragonborn have a connection to the crystal magic used by the pre-Cataclysm empires. Rather than psionic abilities, they can resonate with crystalline structures.

**Abilities Reskinned**:
- **Telepathic abilities** become **Crystal Communication** - can send messages through crystal networks
- **Breath weapons** create crystalline effects rather than pure energy

### **Metallic/Chromatic Dragonborn** ✅ (already covered)

### **Custom Lineage** ✅
**Integration**: Perfect for creating survivors with unique backstories

**Lore**: Represents the many unique individuals whose heritage was affected by the Cataclysm in ways that don't fit standard racial categories. Excellent for creating one-off backgrounds.

### **Remnant Constructs** (adapted from Warforged) ⚙️
**Mechanical Changes**: Keep all Warforged stats, but modify thematic descriptions and add minor features

**Lore Adaptation**: These beings emerged spontaneously during the Cataclysm when massive magical energies interacted with consciousness-affecting spells and inorganic materials. Unlike intentionally crafted Warforged, Remnant Constructs are unique accidents of magical catastrophe - consciousness accidentally bound to crystalline and metallic matrices.

**Physical Description**: Bodies appear to be amalgamations of crystal, metal, and energy. Rather than constructed plating, they have crystalline growths and flowing patterns of energy beneath translucent material. No two look exactly alike.

**Abilities Reskinned**:
- **Constructed Resilience** → **Magical Stability**: Immunity to disease/poison represents their non-biological nature
- **Sentry's Rest** → **Energy Meditation**: They don't sleep but enter a trance-like state where their magical energies stabilize
- **Integrated Protection** → **Adaptive Shell**: Their "armor" is part of their crystalline structure and can shift slightly

**Additional Feature**: **Remnant Resonance** - Can sense areas of high magical activity within 60 feet as a tingling sensation (no mechanical benefit, purely flavor).

**Social Standing**: Extremely rare and viewed with mixture of awe and unease. Most people have never seen one. Often assumed to be either cursed individuals or blessed artifacts come to life.

**Cultural Role**: Often become scholars, artificers, or guardians of magical sites. They have an intuitive understanding of remnant magic but struggle with biological concepts and emotions.

### **Dream Touched** (adapted from Kalashtar) ⚙️
**Mechanical Changes**: Keep all Kalashtar abilities but replace psionic/spirit descriptions

**Lore Adaptation**: Dream Touched are descendants of humans who were caught in temporal magic experiments during the final days of the pre-Cataclysm empires. Instead of connecting to quori spirits, they experience vivid dreams and visions that may be glimpses of alternate timelines, possible futures, or echoes from the past.

**Abilities Reskinned**:
- **Dual Mind** → **Temporal Awareness**: Advantage on Wisdom saves represents their ability to sense multiple potential outcomes
- **Mental Discipline** → **Reality Anchor**: Resistance to psychic damage comes from their experience navigating multiple timeline perceptions  
- **Mind Link** → **Echo Sharing**: Can share their temporal visions/dreams with others telepathically
- **Psychic Glamour** / **Severed from Dreams** → **Timeline Slip**: Can briefly perceive and interact with alternate reality echoes

**Dream Mechanics**: Instead of never dreaming due to quori presence, Dream Touched experience extremely vivid, prophetic dreams that sometimes provide cryptic guidance about future events (DM discretion for actual prophetic value).

**Social Standing**: Often sought out as oracles or advisors, but also feared for their "unnatural" perceptions. Many people find their temporal awareness unsettling.

**Cultural Role**: Frequently become scholars studying pre-Cataclysm events, diviners, or advisors to leaders. Their unique perspective on causality makes them valuable for understanding complex situations.

### **Changelings** ❌ → ⚙️
**Mechanical Issue**: Shapeshifting might conflict with remnant magic instability

**Rework Option**: **Aspect Shifters** - Can change appearance but risk remnant surges when doing so. Shapeshifting requires Constitution saves in high-magic areas.

### **Githyanki/Githzerai** ❌
**Setting Conflict**: Planar background and astral realm focus don't fit the continental scope

**Alternative**: If players want psionic abilities, consider reflavoring as **Mind Touched** - humans affected by experimental psychic magic during the Cataclysm.

### **Astral Elves** ❌
**Setting Conflict**: Astral Plane focus contradicts the grounded, post-apocalyptic setting

**Social Standing**: Generally welcomed for their entertainment value and positive attitude, though some find their carefree nature inappropriate for serious situations.

### **Dhampir** ⚙️
**Mechanical Adjustment**: Replace vampiric heritage with **Umbral Cursed**

**Lore Adaptation**: Rather than vampire spawn, these individuals are descended from people exposed to concentrated umbral/void magic during the Cataclysm. The exposure left them with vampiric-like traits but no actual undead nature.

- **Vampiric Bite** → **Umbral Drain**: Draws life energy through shadow magic connection
- **Spider Climb** → **Shadow Walk**: Can move along surfaces by partially phasing into shadows
- **Undead nature resistance** → **Umbral corruption resistance**

### **Reborn** ⚙️  
**Mechanical Adjustment**: Replace undead nature with **Remnant Reanimated**

**Lore Adaptation**: These individuals died during the Cataclysm but were brought back by accidental exposure to life-affecting remnant magic. They're not true undead but rather living beings restored by chaotic magical forces.

- **Token creation** → **Remnant Anchors**: Create magical connections through crystallized remnant energy

**Social Standing**: Often shunned due to their disturbing appearance and association with dangerous magic.

**Gem Dragonborn**: ✅ (already covered in official section with crystal magic adaptation)
**Metallic/Chromatic variants**: ✅ (work as-is with existing dragonborn lore)

### **Gearforged** ❌ → ⚙️  
**Rework**: **Remnant Clockwork** - Consciousness transferred to magical constructs

**Lore Alternative**: Similar to Remnant Constructs but specifically involving consciousness transfer experiments. Extremely rare individuals whose minds were magically bound to clockwork bodies during desperate pre-Cataclysm experiments.

**Mechanical Notes**: Use Gearforged stats but with crystal/remnant magic power source instead of pure clockwork.

### **Darakhul** ❌
**Setting Conflict**: Intelligent undead empire doesn't fit the post-Cataclysm themes

**Why Banned**: The concept of an organized undead civilization conflicts with the "survivors rebuilding" theme of Alkebulan.

### **Shadow Fey** ❌ → ⚙️

### **Evaluation Criteria for Any 3rd Party Race**
1. **Power Level**: Does it match standard PHB races?
2. **Setting Fit**: Can it be adapted to post-Cataclysm themes?
3. **Social Integration**: What role would it play in rebuilding society?
4. **Magical Consistency**: Do its abilities fit remnant magic rules?
5. **Survival Relevance**: How does it help/hinder in a dangerous world?

### **Red Flags for 3rd Party Races**
- **Overpowered abilities** that overshadow other players
- **Technology requirements** beyond post-Cataclysm capabilities  
- **Planar travel** as core racial identity
- **Inherent evil** that conflicts with heroic gameplay

## **Integration Guidelines for DMs**

### **When Adapting Races**
1. **Preserve Core Fantasy**: Keep what makes the race fun to play
2. **Fit the Setting**: Adapt lore to match post-Cataclysm themes  
3. **Maintain Balance**: Don't make mechanical changes that alter power level
4. **Add Hooks**: Create connections to Alkebulan's history and cultures

### **Regional Variations**
- **[[The Cerulean Reach (old)]]**: More accepting of magical races, cosmopolitan attitudes
- **[[The Amunrai Imperium (x)]]**: Hierarchy-focused, solar-touched races favored
- **Rural/Remote Areas**: Traditional attitudes, emphasis on practical survival skills
- **Remnant Zones**: All races may show signs of magical adaptation or mutation

### **Social Dynamics**
Consider how each race's abilities and appearance affect their interactions with:
- **Local authorities** (city guards, imperial officials)
- **Common folk** (merchants, farmers, laborers)  
- **Other adventurers** (party dynamics and regional reputation)
- **Faction representatives** (Remnant Keepers, Mist Walkers, etc.)
