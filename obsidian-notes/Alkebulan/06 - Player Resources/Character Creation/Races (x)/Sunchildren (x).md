Sunchildren Lore:

Origins:
Sunchildren are believed to be descendants of the first God-Pharaoh of the Amunrai Imperium, who was said to be blessed by the sun god Amunrai himself. They are seen as living embodiments of the sun's power and the divine right to rule.

Nature:
Sunchildren have a deep connection to solar energy. Their skin emits a soft glow, which intensifies with their emotions. Their eyes often appear as swirling pools of golden light. They are naturally drawn to sunlight and tend to be most active during the day.

Role in Amunrai Society:
Sunchildren occupy a privileged position in the Amunrai Imperium. They are often found in positions of leadership, religious authority, or as advisors to the God-Pharaoh. The current God-Pharaoh is always chosen from among the Sunchildren, believed to be the one most favored by Amunrai.

However, not all Sunchildren remain within the Imperium. Some choose to leave, seeking their own paths or questioning the traditions of their society.

Social Structure:
Within the Imperium, Sunchildren form a loose hierarchical structure based on their perceived closeness to the sun god's favor. This is often measured by the intensity of their inner light and their magical abilities.

- Strong sense of duty and responsibility
- Deep reverence for the sun and its cycles
- Emphasis on personal excellence and leadership

Relationship with Other Races:
Within the Imperium, Sunchildren are revered and sometimes feared. Outside the Imperium, reactions vary widely. Some view them with awe, others with suspicion due to their connection to the expanding Amunrai Imperium.
