Mistwalker Lore:

Origins:
Mistwalkers emerged in the aftermath of the great cataclysm that reshaped Alkebulan. Some believe they are descendants of humans caught in powerful magical mists during the disaster, while others claim they're the result of experiments by ancient mages seeking to create the perfect spies. The truth remains shrouded in mystery.

Nature:
Mistwalkers possess a unique connection to the ethereal plane, allowing them to partially shift their bodies into a misty state. This ability, while useful, has led to distrust from other races who find their semi-corporeal nature unsettling.

Society:
Due to widespread suspicion, Mistwalkers rarely form large communities of their own. Instead, they often live on the fringes of other societies or band together in small, nomadic groups. Their ability to blend in and disappear has made them natural survivors in a world that often rejects them.

The Mist Walkers Guild:
While not all Mistwalkers are part of the guild, the Mist Walkers have become a haven for many of their kind. The guild's acceptance of outcasts resonates strongly with the Mistwalker experience. However, the relationship between the race and the guild is complex:

- Many Mistwalkers see the guild as a chance for community and purpose.
- Some embrace the criminal lifestyle, seeing it as a way to strike back at a society that shuns them.
- Others join out of necessity but maintain their own moral codes.
- A significant number of Mistwalkers avoid the guild entirely, seeking to forge their own paths.

Cultural Traits:
- Value adaptability and quick thinking
- Often have a strong sense of loyalty to those who accept them
- Tend to be private about their pasts and true feelings
- Many develop a dry, sometimes fatalistic sense of humor

Naming Conventions:
Mistwalker names often reflect natural phenomena associated with mist, shadow, or etherealness. Some adopt names from the cultures they live among to blend in.
