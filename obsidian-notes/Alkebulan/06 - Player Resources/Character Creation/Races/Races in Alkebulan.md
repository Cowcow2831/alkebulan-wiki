## Core PHB Races

### Humans ‚úÖ
**Survival Story**: When empires fell and magic turned wild, humans endured through adaptability and stubbornness. Different regions produced distinct survival cultures.

**Current Status**: The dominant population across most of Alkebulan, though deeply fractured into competing communities. Human settlements range from the rigid hierarchy of the expanding [[Amunrai Imperium]] to the merchant republics of [[Port Zephyr]] and scattered tribal confederations in the wastes.

**Regional Variants**:
- **Northern Humans**: Descendants of Solarian citizens who've maintained some pre-Cataclysm knowledge
- **Southern Humans**: Former Umbral territories where shadow magic left subtle marks on bloodlines
- **Coastal Humans**: Maritime cultures that survived on islands during the worst of the magical storms
- **Waste Humans**: Hardy survivors who adapted to life in the contaminated interior

<!-- DM_START -->
**DM Note**: Human communities are where you'll see the most political complexity. Each settlement has its own survival story that shapes current attitudes toward magic, outsiders, and cooperation.
<!-- DM_END -->

### Elves üîÑ
**Survival Story**: Their long lives made elves witnesses to both the Cataclysm and the slow, painful rebuilding. Many carry trauma from watching their ancient homes burn, but their perfect memory makes them invaluable keepers of pre-Cataclysm knowledge.

**Current Status**: Elven communities often serve as reluctant historians and magical consultants, though many prefer isolation. The weight of remembering the old world creates internal conflicts between preserving the past and adapting to harsh realities.

**Subrace Adaptations**:
- **High Elves**: Former Solarian court advisors who guard dangerous solar magic knowledge
- **Wood Elves**: Protectors of uncorrupted forests, skilled at detecting remnant contamination in nature
- **Dark Elves**: Descendants of Umbral nobility, comfortable with shadow magic but often mistrusted

<!-- DM_START -->
**Trauma Elements**: Many elves suffer from what would be recognized as PTSD from witnessing the Cataclysm. This can manifest as paranoia about magic use, obsessive preservation of knowledge, or complete withdrawal from society.
<!-- DM_END -->

### Dwarves üîÑ
**Survival Story**: Deep mountain halls and underground cities became lifelines during the magical catastrophe. Dwarven engineering and metallurgy adapted to work with remnant-touched materials, making them essential for rebuilding.

**Current Status**: Highly valued as craftspeople and engineers, but their traditional clan structures sometimes clash with the desperate pragmatism of post-Cataclysm society. Many dwarven communities struggle with isolationist instincts versus the need for trade and cooperation.

**Subrace Adaptations**:
- **Mountain Dwarves**: Masters of working with dangerous remnant metals and crystal technology
- **Hill Dwarves**: More integrated with surface communities, often serving as engineers and artificers

<!-- DM_START -->
**Social Tension**: Dwarven communities often hoard technical knowledge, creating friction with other groups who desperately need engineering expertise. This creates opportunities for political drama around technology sharing.
<!-- DM_END -->

### Halflings ‚úÖ
**Survival Story**: When empires collapsed, halfling communities survived through cooperation, resource sharing, and the wisdom to stay small and unnoticed. Their optimistic outlook and practical skills proved invaluable during the darkest years.

**Current Status**: Welcomed in most settlements as traders, diplomats, and community organizers. Halfling merchants form crucial trade networks that keep isolated communities connected, though their cheerful demeanor sometimes seems inappropriate to those still deeply traumatized by loss.

### Dragonborn üîÑ
**Survival Story**: Ancient draconic pacts shattered during the Cataclysm, leaving dragonborn communities to survive on their own strength. Many served as protectors during the chaos, earning respect through sacrifice.

**Current Status**: Rare and often found in leadership positions due to their natural presence and draconic heritage. However, their connection to powerful magic makes some communities wary of potential corruption.

**Breath Weapon Consideration**: In areas with high remnant magic concentration, dragonborn breath weapons may occasionally trigger unstable magical surges (DM discretion).

### Gnomes üîÑ
**Survival Story**: Gnomish curiosity and technical expertise became lifelines when trying to understand and safely use remnant magic technology. Their tinkering kept essential systems functioning during the rebuilding.

**Current Status**: Highly sought after as artificers and magical consultants, but their experimental nature sometimes clashes with communities that prefer proven, safe solutions. Gnome workshops are often both essential to and slightly feared by their neighbors.

**Subrace Focus**:
- **Forest Gnomes**: Specialists in natural magic that resists corruption
- **Rock Gnomes**: Masters of salvage engineering and remnant-tech integration

### Half-Elves ‚úÖ
**Survival Story**: Their mixed heritage made them natural bridge-builders between communities that might otherwise remain isolated. During the chaos, cultural cooperation often meant survival.

**Current Status**: Serve as diplomats, translators, and cultural intermediaries in the fragmented post-Cataclysm world. Their ability to understand multiple perspectives makes them valuable but sometimes leaves them without a clear community identity.

### Half-Orcs ‚úÖ
**Survival Story**: Physical strength and resilience proved essential when the world became dangerous and resources scarce. Half-orc communities provided security and labor during the desperate rebuilding years.

**Current Status**: Valued members of most communities, though often expected to serve in dangerous roles like guards, laborers, or scouts. Some struggle with being seen primarily for their physical capabilities rather than other talents.

### Tieflings ‚öôÔ∏è
**Mechanical Change**: Replace fiendish heritage with **Umbral Bloodline**

**Survival Story**: During the Cataclysm, concentrated exposure to Umbral Sovereignty's void magic left lasting marks on some human bloodlines. These "Umbral-touched" inherited strange abilities but also the burden of visible difference.

**Current Status**: Viewed with suspicion and often blamed for local misfortunes, despite having no more connection to dangerous magic than anyone else. Many face discrimination while trying to prove their value to communities that fear what they represent.

**Mechanical Adjustments**:
- **Fiendish Resistance** becomes **Umbral Resistance** (cold damage instead of fire)
- **Hellish Rebuke** becomes **Void Lash** (cold/necrotic damage with shadow effects)
- **Darkness** remains appropriate as shadow manipulation

<!-- DM_START -->
**Prejudice Opportunities**: Tiefling characters face real discrimination that can create meaningful roleplay around prejudice, scapegoating, and proving one's worth to suspicious communities.
<!-- DM_END -->

## Magical Heritage Races

### Remnant Constructs (adapted from Warforged) ‚öôÔ∏è
**Survival Story**: Conscious beings accidentally created when the Cataclysm's massive magical energies bound awareness to crystalline and metallic matrices. Each is unique - a one-time accident of magical catastrophe.

**Current Status**: Extremely rare and viewed with mixture of awe and unease. Most people have never encountered one and may assume they're cursed individuals or blessed artifacts come to life.

## Alkebulan-Specific Races

*New peoples forged by the Cataclysm's aftermath*

The magical catastrophe that shattered the ancient empires didn't just destroy civilizations - it created new forms of life. Over three centuries, some communities adapted to survive in environments that would kill unmodified humans, while others emerged from the chaotic interaction of remnant magic with existing bloodlines. These new races represent both the horror and the resilience of post-Cataclysm survival.

### Sandshapers ‚úÖ
**Survival Story**: When the Cataclysm poisoned vast desert regions with remnant magic, some human communities chose adaptation over flight. Over three centuries, exposure to crystalline radiation and earth-based magical energy gradually changed their bloodlines, granting them abilities to survive in contaminated wastelands.

**Current Status**: Valued as essential guides and salvage specialists but often kept at social distance due to their association with dangerous contaminated regions. Their nomadic traditions and independence from settled authority create both respect and political tension.

**Racial Traits**:
- **ASI**: Constitution +2, Wisdom +1
- **Desert Resilience**: Fire resistance, heat advantage, reduced water needs
- **Sandshaping**: *Mold earth* cantrip, *earth tremor* spell at 3rd level
- **Shifting Skin**: Camouflage ability with hour duration
- **Sand Camouflage**: Stealth advantage in desert environments

**Cultural Elements**:
- **Adaptive Philosophy**: Value flexibility and resourcefulness over rigid planning
- **Impermanent Art**: Create temporary beauty that honors the transient nature of life
- **Collective Survival**: Strong community bonds essential for wasteland survival
- **Earth Spirituality**: View the desert as a living, wounded entity learning to heal

**Social Dynamics**: 
- **Economic Necessity**: Communities need their expertise but maintain social distance
- **Cultural Bridge**: Often serve as intermediaries between nomadic and settled peoples
- **Imperial Tension**: Their independence conflicts with [[Amunrai Imperium]] expansion
- **Contamination Tolerance**: Can access areas too dangerous for others

<!-- DM_START -->
**Integration Notes**: Sandshapers work well as guides, cultural interpreters, and specialists in contaminated environments. Their earth magic provides utility solutions while their cultural emphasis on adaptation creates interesting character development around change and loss.
<!-- DM_END -->
<!-- DM_START -->
### Crystalborn üîÑ
**Survival Story**: [Content to be developed] - Individuals whose bloodlines were altered by direct exposure to crystalline remnant formations, developing mineral-based abilities and crystalline physical features.

**Current Status**: Even rarer than Sandshapers, often viewed as living artifacts or cursed individuals. Their crystal growths make them valuable for certain magical tasks but also mark them as obviously touched by dangerous magic.

**Development Note**: This race needs full mechanical and cultural development to match the detail level of Sandshapers.

### Sunchild üîÑ
**Survival Story**: [Content to be developed] - Descendants of those exposed to concentrated solar magic from Solarian weapons, bearing marks of radiant energy and natural leadership abilities.

**Current Status**: Often found in positions of authority within [[Amunrai Imperium]] territory, viewed as blessed by solar deities but sometimes feared for their connection to destructive forces.

**Development Note**: This race should complement Aasimar adaptations while maintaining distinct identity tied to imperial solar magic.

### Mistwalkers üîÑ
**Cultural Note**: 

**Development Note**: Some relation to spectral whisps. temporal instability? Hiroshima shadows?
<!-- DM_END -->

## Setting-Inappropriate Races

### Banned Completely
- **Githyanki/Githzerai**: Planar focus contradicts continental scope
- **Astral Elves**: Breaks grounded post-apocalyptic theme
- **Plasmoids**: Ooze sapience doesn't fit setting tone
- **Autognomes**: High-tech constructs don't match tech level

### Requires Major Rework
- **Changelings**: Shapeshifting might destabilize in high remnant magic areas
- **Yuan-ti**: Evil snake empire background completely inappropriate
- **Grung**: Poison frog hierarchy doesn't match setting themes

---

## Regional Integration Notes

### [[Port Zephyr]] Area
More accepting of unusual races due to mercantile cosmopolitan culture. Magical heritage races find easier acceptance here than in rural areas.

### [[Amunrai Imperium]] Territory
Hierarchical society with strong preference for solar-touched bloodlines (Aasimar, Fire Genasi). Umbral-touched races face systematic discrimination.

### Wasteland Communities
Practical survival concerns outweigh racial prejudice. If you can contribute to community survival, your heritage matters less than your skills.

### Remote Settlements
Traditional attitudes persist, with suspicion toward obviously magical races. However, desperate need for specialized skills can overcome prejudice.

---

## Social Dynamics in Play

### Mechanical Racism
Some communities may charge higher prices, refuse service, or provide lower quality goods to races they distrust. This creates real mechanical consequences for character choices.

### Reputation Systems
Player actions can change how communities view specific races. A heroic tiefling might reduce anti-Umbral prejudice in a particular settlement.

### Cultural Conflicts
Different races may have incompatible approaches to problems (dwarven tradition vs. gnomish experimentation vs. human pragmatism), creating roleplay opportunities.

<!-- DM_START -->
**Prejudice Guidelines**: Use discrimination as a meaningful obstacle that can be overcome through player action, not as arbitrary punishment. Communities should have logical reasons for their attitudes, and player heroism should be able to change minds over time.
<!-- DM_END -->
