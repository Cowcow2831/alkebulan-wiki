## Combat Rules

### Powerful Crits

- **Weapon Damage:** When a critical hit lands, weapon damage dice follow "Perfect Crit Rules" (roll the dice, then add the maximum dice value)
- **Additional Dice:** Any additional dice rolled (Sneak Attack, Divine Smite, Brutal Critical, etc.) are doubled
- **Spell Crits:** Damage dice on spell crits are also doubled

### Altered Flanking

- **Standard Flanking:** Gives attacking creatures **+2 to attack rolls** instead of advantage
- **Stacking:** Rule stacks - if three creatures surround an enemy, they all get **+4**, up to a **MAX of +6**
- **Size Limitation:** Has no effect on creatures size **Large or greater**
- **Height Advantage:** Grants a flat **+2 bonus** to attack roll
    - **Does** affect creatures size Large or greater

### Crit Fumbles _(Until Level 5)_

- **Duration:** Until party reaches **Level 5** (represents inexperience as adventurers)
- **Trigger:** On a roll of **1** on an attack roll, roll a **d100**
- **Effect:** Resulting roll triggers corresponding result on fumble table
- **Graduation:** Once you reach Level 5, no more rookie mistakes!

## Death & Healing Rules

### Blind Death Saves

- **Process:** DM rolls death saves for players when they fall unconscious
- **Purpose:** Adds sense of dread and tension when party members go down

### Quality Healing Potions

- **Mechanic:** Use the **highest amount** a dice can roll
- **Example:** Basic Potion of Healing (normally 2d4+2) heals **8+2 = 10 HP**
- **Rationale:** Eliminates die rolling math, keeps combat flowing

### Brutal Knockouts

- **Trigger:** When you drop unconscious and are healed
- **Save:** Must pass **CON save (DC 10 + # of times knocked out)**
- **Failure:** Suffer **1 level of exhaustion**
- **Death:** If killed outright and revived, suffer exhaustion **automatically**

### Fading Spirit Resurrections

- **Caster Check:** Spellcasting Ability check required by caster
- **Ally Help:** Allies can make ritual contributions to reduce DC with ability checks
- **DC Formula:** Deceased's Save DC = **10 + (number of deaths)**
- **Success:** Return to life with minor penalties
- **Failure:** Spirit severed from material body, requires drastic action

## Miscellaneous Rules

- **Mechanic:** Extra advantage dice for any attack/check/save at player's discretion
- **Earned By:**
    - Excellent roleplay (DM reward)
    - Birthday present
