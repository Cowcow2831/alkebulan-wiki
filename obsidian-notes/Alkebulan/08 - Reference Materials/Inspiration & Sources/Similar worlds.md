- "Builders" (pre-apocalypse civilization) left dangerous artifacts
- Radiation is reskinned as magical contamination
- Secret organizations try to prevent another catastrophe
- Morally complex characters in a gritty, dark world

## **Key Differences from Your World**

Most similar worlds differ from yours in important ways:

**Your Unique Elements:**

- **300-year recovery timeline** - Most are either immediate post-apocalypse or far future
- **Successful rebuilding** - Many stay in permanent decline
- **Hope despite darkness** - Many are purely grimdark
- **African-inspired setting** - Most use European/American analogues
- **Magical contamination as radiation allegory** - Most keep magic and technology separate
- **Secret peacekeepers** - Most have secret organizations as manipulators or villains
- **Trading hub prosperity** - Many focus only on scarcity and survival

Your world is unique in combining post-nuclear themes with African cultural elements, showing successful rebuilding rather than permanent collapse, and maintaining hope while still being dark and gritty. The 300-year timeline puts you in a sweet spot between immediate post-apocalypse survival and far-future forgetting - people remember enough to be cautious but have built enough to have hope.
