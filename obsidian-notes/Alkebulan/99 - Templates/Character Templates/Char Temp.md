###### Actions in Combat
	Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Grapple, Help, Hide, Improvise, Influence, Magic, Ready, Search, Shove, Study, Utilize
###### Devastator
	Make a weapon attack. Choose up to 4 willing creatures within 30ft. Each Creature can use a reaction ot make a weapon attack or cast a damage-dealing cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. Once per short rest.
###### Infernal Conduit 
	Touch a creature, spend 1+ Infernal Conduit dice (d10s), target makes CON save vs. your interdict DC (can willingly fail). Choose effect:

	Invigorate: Failed save = target regains HP equal to total rolled, you take that much necrotic damage. Success = target regains half, you take full damage.

	Devour: Failed save = target takes necrotic damage equal to total rolled, you regain that much HP. Success = target takes half damage, you regain the damage dealt. At 11th level, failed save also causes 1 exhaustion.

	Necrotic damage can't be reduced. If it drops you to 0 HP, you fall unconscious and stabilize. Regain spent dice on long rest.
### Bonus Actions
###### Baleful Interdict (Bonus Action or Free with Weapon Hit) 
	Place a magical seal on a creature within 30 feet (bonus action) or automatically when you hit with a weapon attack (no action). Seals last 1 minute and are invisible to others. When an interdicted creature takes damage from any source, you can burn seals to deal 1d6 fire/necrotic damage per seal (no action, but can't while incapacitated). At 5th level: 2d6 per seal. If interdicted creature dies, move all seals to new creature within 30 feet (bonus action).
###### Shadow Shroud
	You can expend a seal as a bonus action to weave a mantle of semisolid shadows around yourself or a creature you touch. The target gains +2 AC for 1 minute

### Reactions
###### Invoke Hell: Punishment
	When a creature damages you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes necrotic damage equal to the damage they dealt you with the triggering attack. On a successful save, the attacker takes half as much damage.
###### Telekinetic Seal
	When a creature you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to place a seal on them. When you do, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be either pushed back 15 feet or knocked prone (your choice).

### Other
###### Invoke Hell: Grand Strategist
	You can order your allies to follow your formation (no action required). Choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you who can hear you, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Each target can immediately move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
###### Quick Step
	If you move at least 10 feet on your turn, attack rolls against you have disadvantage until the start of your next turn. This feature does not function if you are¬†incapacitated¬†or¬†restrained. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your level.
###### Soul Eater
	When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can activate this boon (no action required) to gain¬†temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level.
###### Blood Price
	You can strengthen your defenses at the cost of your vitality. Whenever you fail a saving throw, you can spend one of your Hit Dice, rolling it and adding the number rolled to the result of the save.
