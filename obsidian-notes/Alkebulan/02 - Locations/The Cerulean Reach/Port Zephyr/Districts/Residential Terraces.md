# Residential Terraces

## Overview
**Type:** Stratified Residential District/Housing Zones
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]] ([[Port Zephyr]])
**Population:** Approximately 5,500 residents across multiple contamination-risk levels
**Government:** Managed by District Wardens under strict Council oversight, with [[City Watch Officers]] enforcing contamination protocols
**Contamination Level:** Variable by elevation (Low to Moderate, strictly monitored)

## Description

Built into the hillsides between the poisonous [[Harbor District]] and the purified [[Hill Ward]], the Residential Terraces house [[Port Zephyr]]'s middle and working classes in a masterwork of contamination management disguised as urban planning. The district's terraced design serves a brutal dual purpose: maximizing views for those who can afford cleaner air while creating clear elevation-based social stratification where your height above sea level literally determines your life expectancy.

The terraces operate on the fundamental post-Cataclysm principle that survival requires accepting calculated risks. Every residence includes mandatory contamination monitoring equipment, emergency decontamination supplies, and evacuation protocols. The architecture reflects this reality—reinforced construction using tested materials, shared purification systems that residents must maintain collectively, and community spaces designed to facilitate mutual aid during contamination emergencies.

**Lower Terraces (Contamination Risk: Moderate)**
House skilled workers who can afford basic protective equipment but not complete isolation from harbor contamination. Artisans, shopkeepers, and junior guild members live in modest homes built around communal decontamination facilities. These neighborhoods feature shared medical clinics specializing in contamination exposure, community gardens that require soil testing, and strong mutual aid networks born from shared vulnerability. Residents here typically show minor symptoms of chronic exposure—slight tremors, occasional nausea, elevated cancer rates—but these communities have developed sophisticated support systems for managing health risks collectively.

**Middle Terraces (Contamination Risk: Low-Moderate)**
Accommodate successful craftsmen, ship officers, and established professionals who can afford private protective equipment and periodic medical monitoring. Larger residences feature personal decontamination chambers, improved air filtration, and private gardens using imported clean soil. These neighborhoods balance individual security with community cooperation, maintaining shared emergency protocols while providing enough privacy for families to cope with the psychological strain of constant vigilance.

**Upper Terraces (Contamination Risk: Low)**
House wealthy merchants, senior guild members, and successful professionals who approach but haven't achieved merchant prince status. Spacious homes feature advanced purification systems, emergency bunkers, and harbor views that serve both aesthetic and practical purposes—monitoring contamination levels and potential threats from below. These residents live with the guilt of relative safety while depending on the labor of those more exposed, creating complex social dynamics around responsibility and complicity.

## Notes

The Residential Terraces represent the middle ground of post-Cataclysm survival—communities that have achieved relative safety through collective action and mutual aid, but only by accepting calculated exposure to environmental dangers. The district demonstrates how environmental inequality creates complex social dynamics where survival depends on both individual advancement and community solidarity.

The terraces serve as a perfect example of the campaign's core themes: communities finding hope through cooperation while being forced to make difficult choices about who bears the cost of collective survival. Residents live with the constant tension between protecting themselves and protecting their neighbors, between accepting current conditions and fighting for something better.

Adventures in the Residential Terraces should emphasize community relationships, environmental justice themes, and the moral complexity of survival in a contaminated world where every safety measure has a human cost.

*In the Residential Terraces, safety is something you build together, knowing that everyone's protection depends on accepting that someone, somewhere, is still paying the price.*
