# Harbor District

## Overview
**Type:** Industrial/Maritime Hub and Contamination Zone
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach (old)]] ([[Port Zephyr]])
**Population:** Approximately 3,000 residents, plus 1,500+ transient workers and refugees
**Government:** Overseen by [[Harbor Officials]] under direct Council control, with heavily armed [[City Watch Officers]] maintaining brutal order
**Contamination Level:** Moderate to High (varies by location and tidal conditions)

## Description

The Harbor District sprawls along [[Port Zephyr]]'s contaminated waterfront like a festering wound that the city cannot afford to heal. This industrial zone serves as both the source of the city's wealth and the graveyard of its working class, where massive docks accommodate vessels ranging from desperate fishing boats to imperial merchant galleons and the dangerous experimental [[Airships]] that represent humanity's reckless attempts to bypass ground-based contamination.

The district extends from the main harbor piers through a maze of warehouses, decontamination stations, worker barracks, and businesses that profit from desperation. The architecture reflects harsh pragmatism—reinforced concrete and salvaged steel built to contain contamination as much as to shelter inhabitants. Buildings rarely exceed three stories due to foundation instability from harbor pollution, with ground floors serving as workshops and storage while upper levels house workers in cramped, poorly ventilated quarters.

The harbor itself glows with an eerie phosphorescence after dark, a visible reminder of the magical contamination that permeates every surface. Different sections of the waterfront carry different risks: the **Eastern Glow Docks** are so contaminated that workers require full protective gear and rarely survive more than six months of employment, while the **Western Clean Berths** (a relative term) handle goods bound for the Hill Ward and require only basic decontamination protocols.

**Decontamination Infrastructure** dominates the district's layout. Every major thoroughfare features mandatory washing stations, radiation detectors jury-rigged from pre-Cataclysm salvage, and disposal sites for contaminated materials. The famous **Purge Gates** separate the Harbor District from cleaner areas, requiring all workers to undergo painful decontamination procedures before entering other parts of the city.

The district operates on a brutal but necessary rhythm. Dawn brings the **Death Shifts**—workers heading to the most contaminated areas for premium pay and short life expectancy. Midday sees the **Salvage Crews** returning from expeditions to underwater ruins, their hauls potentially valuable enough to justify the cancer they've absorbed. Evening transforms the area into a desperate social hub where workers drink away their radiation sickness in taverns that serve as much as hospitals as gathering places.

## Notes

The Harbor District represents the fundamental moral contradiction of post-Cataclysm survival: the necessities that keep society alive are slowly killing those who provide them. Every economic transaction involves choosing between profit and human life, every safety measure comes at the cost of reduced productivity, and every day of continued prosperity is built on the calculated sacrifice of workers who have no other options.

The district serves as a perfect microcosm of the campaign's core themes—environmental contamination as ongoing crisis, economic exploitation disguised as mutual benefit, and communities finding solidarity in shared suffering while being pitted against each other by systemic pressures beyond their control.
