# The Floating Gardens

## Overview
**Type:** Contaminated Agricultural Platforms/Survival Infrastructure
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach (old)]] ([[Port Zephyr]] Harbor)
**Population:** 200+ agricultural workers, gardeners, and maintenance crews
**Government:** Controlled by the Agricultural Guild under Council oversight
**Contamination Level:** Moderate to High (varies by platform and tidal conditions)

## Description

The Floating Gardens represent [[Port Zephyr]]'s desperate adaptation to a poisoned world—a collection of artificial agricultural platforms drifting in the harbor's contaminated waters like lifeboats for a starving city. These installations were born from necessity when harbor contamination made traditional soil-based agriculture impossible, forcing the city to develop food production methods that could survive in magically poisoned waters while slowly killing those who tend them.

Approximately thirty platforms of varying sizes drift within the harbor's protective embrace, tethered by massive chains and connected by floating walkways that rise and fall with the contaminated tides. Each platform serves as a miniature ecosystem where carefully selected crops grow in soil that requires constant magical purification, tended by workers who accept shortened lifespans in exchange for wages that might support their families.

The platforms themselves are marvels of desperate engineering—pre-Cataclysm floating technology jury-rigged with salvaged materials and maintained through dangerous diving operations in the harbor's toxic depths. Each garden requires constant monitoring for contamination levels, regular soil replacement, and frequent worker rotation to prevent fatal exposure accumulation.

**Agricultural Zones** are arranged by contamination tolerance and economic value. **Safe Crop Platforms** grow basic staples using heavily purified soil and water, producing food clean enough for the Hill Ward but requiring enormous resource investment. **Adaptation Platforms** experiment with crops that can tolerate moderate contamination, producing affordable food for the working classes while slowly poisoning both plants and consumers. **Extraction Platforms** harvest harbor resources—contaminated kelp, toxic fish, and magical algae—that can be processed into medicines, industrial materials, and food supplements for the desperate.

## Notes

The Floating Gardens represent the fundamental compromise of post-Cataclysm survival: accepting environmental destruction and human suffering as the price of continued existence. The platforms demonstrate how communities can adapt to impossible conditions through innovation and cooperation, but only by accepting that someone must pay the ultimate price for collective survival.

The gardens serve as a perfect microcosm of the campaign's environmental themes—showing how contamination creates class divisions, how survival requires both individual sacrifice and community solidarity, and how even necessary adaptation comes with moral costs that society must somehow bear.

Adventures involving the Floating Gardens should emphasize environmental justice, worker solidarity, and the complex relationships between technological innovation and human exploitation in a world where clean food is a luxury built on the suffering of those who produce it.

*In the Floating Gardens, every meal is a choice between hunger and poison, every harvest a gamble with workers' lives, and every innovation a step forward built on suffering that society pretends is necessary.*
