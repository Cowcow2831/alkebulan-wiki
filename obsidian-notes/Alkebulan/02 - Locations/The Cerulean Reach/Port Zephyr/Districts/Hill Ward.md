# Hill Ward

## Overview
**Type:** Elite Fortress District/Government Quarter
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach (old)]] ([[Port Zephyr]])
**Population:** Approximately 600 residents, plus 400+ servants, guards, and staff
**Government:** Direct control by [[Council Members]] with elite [[City Watch Officers]] and private security
**Contamination Level:** Minimal (artificially maintained through technological and magical purification)

## Description

Perched atop [[Port Zephyr]]'s highest hills like a crown of privilege above a foundation of suffering, the Hill Ward represents the ultimate expression of wealth's power to literally rise above contamination. This exclusive fortress district houses the palatial estates of merchant princes, imperial diplomats, and the city's ruling elite, while serving as the seat of government where the [[Council Members|Council of Merchant Princes]] orchestrate the systematic exploitation that maintains their power.

The district's elevated position provides commanding surveillance of the entire harbor, [[The Floating Gardens]], and the worker districts below—a practical necessity for monitoring potential unrest and a powerful symbol of social stratification. The clean, wide streets are paved with imported stone that's regularly tested for contamination, lined with flowering trees that require constant magical purification to survive the ambient radiation from the harbor below.

**Purification Infrastructure** dominates the district's hidden architecture. Massive filtration systems, magical ward networks, and atmospheric processors work constantly to maintain an artificial bubble of safety. The cost of this protection—in both resources and human labor—exceeds the annual income of most settlements, but it ensures that the ruling class can live without the constant fear of contamination that defines life for everyone else.

Architecture in the Hill Ward reflects both defensive necessity and ostentatious wealth. Mansions incorporate salvaged pre-Cataclysm materials not just for their beauty but for their radiation-resistant properties. Amunrai-inspired columned facades hide reinforced bunkers, while tropical-adapted pavilions feature hidden panic rooms. Every estate includes private decontamination facilities, emergency shelters, and escape routes leading to the harbor through sealed tunnels.

The district operates under martial social protocols disguised as refined etiquette. Servants and tradespeople move through designated paths and times, their exposure to contamination carefully monitored to prevent them from bringing poison into the clean zones. Formal dress requirements include discrete radiation detection devices, and visitors must undergo thorough decontamination and background investigation to avoid "security risks."

## Notes

The Hill Ward represents the ultimate expression of environmental inequality—a bubble of artificial safety maintained through the systematic exploitation of those forced to live in contamination. Every breath of clean air, every sip of pure water, and every moment of safety is purchased with the suffering of workers in the districts below.

The district serves as a perfect symbol of the campaign's core themes: systems that preserve privilege through environmental apartheid, the moral corruption that comes from benefiting from others' suffering, and the inherent instability of arrangements that depend on keeping the majority of the population desperate and powerless.

Adventures in the Hill Ward should emphasize the stark contrasts between the lives of the privileged few and the contaminated many, while providing opportunities for players to navigate complex moral choices about whether to work within a corrupt system or risk everything to change it.

*In the Hill Ward, cleanliness is power, power is safety, and safety is built on a foundation of others' suffering.*
