# Port Zephyr

<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
## Overview

**Type:** Major Trading City/Port  
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]]  
**Population:** Approximately 10,000 permanent residents (estimated 2,000 more in transient workers and refugees)  
**Government:** Council of Merchant Princes (7 elected representatives chosen by property owners), with [[Legal System and Authorities in Port Zephyr|City Watch]] maintaining order

## Description

Port Zephyr clings to life as the crown jewel of [[The Cerulean Reach]], a bustling trade hub built on the bones of a pre-Cataclysm city. The city rises in stark terraces from a harbor where contaminated waters mix with clean, creating a patchwork of prosperity and suffering that captures the realities of post-[[The Cataclysm]] survival.

The natural bay that shelters Port Zephyr from storms also traps magical contamination from centuries of shipping Remnant artifacts and pre-Cataclysm salvage. The harbor glows with an unnatural phosphorescence on moonless nights, and dock workers develop telltale tremors and lesions of chronic Remnant exposure. Yet the city endures because it must—the alternative to controlled contamination is starvation in the wasteland beyond.

Built into terraced hillsides, Port Zephyr's geography creates clear social stratification. The wealthy literally live above the contamination while the poor work in it daily. This elevation-based class system represents survival itself—every meter of height above the harbor means cleaner air, safer water, and longer life.

### City Layout and Districts

#### [[Harbor District]]
The beating heart of Port Zephyr's economy and its most dangerous neighborhood. Massive docks accommodate vessels from desperate fishing boats to imperial merchant galleons and jury-rigged [[Airships]]. The constant activity of sailors, dockworkers, and traders creates vibrant atmosphere shadowed by the knowledge that everyone here slowly poisons themselves for survival.

- **The Glow Docks:** Eastern harbor facilities so contaminated they phosphoresce at night, worked only by the condemned and desperate
- **Warehouse Row:** Stores everything from exotic goods to contaminated materials requiring protective gear
- **Decontamination Centers:** Mandatory purification stations between work and residential areas

#### [[Merchant Quarter]]
Rising from harbor's edge, this district houses grand bazaars and trading houses where Port Zephyr's wealth is generated. Architecture reflects international influence and desperate improvisation—elegant facades built from salvaged pre-Cataclysm materials.

- **Grand Bazaar:** Sprawling marketplace offering everything from local crafts to illegal Remnant artifacts
- **Trading Houses:** International commerce centers with "purity certification" systems
- **Underground Markets:** Hidden venues for goods too dangerous for surface trading

#### [[Residential Terraces]]
Built into hillsides using traditional construction and salvaged materials, these terraced neighborhoods house most of Port Zephyr's population in carefully stratified hierarchy. Lower terraces house workers in cramped quarters around communal decontamination facilities. Higher terraces feature spacious housing with private purification systems.

#### [[Hill Ward]]
The most exclusive and safest district, perched on high hills where pre-Cataclysm ruins provide building materials and magical protection. Wealthy merchant princes maintain estates built around salvaged cores, foreign dignitaries conduct business in buildings with functioning air purification.

### Architecture and Infrastructure

Port Zephyr's architecture reflects survival needs and the harsh realities of building with contaminated materials:

- **Salvage-Based Construction:** Buildings incorporate pre-Cataclysm materials of unknown contamination levels
- **Terraced Adaptation:** Hillside construction maximizes drainage while creating barriers between contamination zones  
- **Storm Resistance:** Designed to withstand natural storms and magical weather phenomena
- **Harbor Engineering:** Sophisticated dock systems accommodate various vessels while attempting to contain contamination
- **Vertical Systems:** Water, waste, and air infrastructure moves contamination downhill away from wealthy districts

## Notable Features

- **[[The Sapphire Lighthouse]]:** Pre-Cataclysm magical beacon guiding ships through contaminated waters
- **The Grand Bazaar:** Sprawling marketplace where legitimate goods mingle with contraband
- **[[The Floating Gardens]]:** Agricultural platforms in harbor's "safer" waters, producing crops while slowly poisoning tenders
- **Zephyr's Spire:** Seat of city government, built around pre-Cataclysm tower with functioning purification systems
- **The Skyport:** Dangerous facility for [[Airships|airship]] docking, attempting to bypass ground contamination routes
- **Decontamination Gates:** Checkpoints between districts with mandatory purification procedures

*Port Zephyr represents the fundamental truth of post-Cataclysm survival: progress is possible, but it demands that someone pay the price in blood, health, and moral compromise. The city endures not because it has overcome the disasters of the past, but because it has learned to build prosperity on a foundation of controlled suffering.*
