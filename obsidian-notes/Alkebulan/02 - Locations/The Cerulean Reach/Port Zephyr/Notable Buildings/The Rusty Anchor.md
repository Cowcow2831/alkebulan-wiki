# The Rusty Anchor

## Overview
**Type:** Working-Class Tavern/Contaminated Worker Hub/Information Exchange
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]] ([[Port Zephyr]] - [[Harbor District]])
**Population:** 50-80 patrons nightly, plus 10+ staff and residents
**Government:** Nominally independent establishment under Harbor District oversight

## Description

The Rusty Anchor squats like a defiant fortress of working-class solidarity in the heart of the contaminated [[Harbor District]], serving as both refuge and resistance center for [[Port Zephyr]]'s most exploited population. This three-story establishment caters to dock workers, sailors, and contamination-exposed laborers who cannot afford the clean comfort of establishments in higher districts, creating a community bound together by shared suffering and mutual aid in the face of systematic environmental oppression.

Built from salvaged ship timbers and reinforced with whatever materials could be scrounged from the harbor, the building bears the scars of both time and contamination. The exterior walls show the telltale discoloration of exposure to magical radiation, while the interior maintains the rough, practical atmosphere of a place where survival trumps aesthetics. The main common room features mismatched furniture built for durability, walls lined with maritime salvage and worker tools, and an atmosphere thick with pipe smoke that helps mask the metallic taste of contaminated air.

**[[One-Eyed Jack]]** operates the establishment with the grim pragmatism of someone who understands that his clientele faces daily choices between starvation and slow poisoning. The tavern serves contaminated food and drink at prices the working class can afford, while providing the only social space where contaminated workers can gather without judgment or persecution. Jack's policy of "no questions, no names, no problems" makes the Anchor a natural hub for information exchange, resistance planning, and mutual aid coordination.

The establishment operates on the fundamental principle that dignity and community can exist even in the face of systematic dehumanization. Workers share information about contamination levels, safe routes, and employment opportunities, while also organizing informal support networks for families whose breadwinners have succumbed to exposure-related illness. The Anchor serves as both a symbol of worker resilience and a practical center for survival in a poisoned world.

**Contamination acceptance** pervades every aspect of the establishment's operations. The water is filtered through basic systems that remove the worst contaminants but cannot eliminate the subtle magical radiation that accumulates in the harbor. Food consists largely of fish caught in contaminated waters and vegetables grown in tainted soil, prepared and served by workers who accept exposure as the price of employment. Customers understand that every meal and drink carries health risks, but consider this an acceptable trade-off for community, affordability, and the dignity of being served without judgment.

The building's **three-story structure** reflects the harsh realities of contaminated housing. The ground floor houses the common room, kitchen, and storage areas where most contamination exposure occurs. The second floor provides basic sleeping quarters for transient workers and sailors who need cheap, immediate accommodation. The third floor, slightly safer due to elevation, houses permanent residents including One-Eyed Jack and long-term workers who've built community relationships that transcend mere commercial transactions.

## Notes

The Rusty Anchor represents the heart of working-class resistance to environmental apartheidâ€”a place where those systematically poisoned by the city's economic system can find community, dignity, and mutual support. The establishment demonstrates how solidarity and culture can flourish even under conditions of systematic oppression, while also serving as a practical center for organizing resistance to contamination-based exploitation.

The tavern serves as a perfect microcosm of the campaign's core themes: communities finding strength through shared struggle, the moral complexity of survival in a contaminated world, and the ways that environmental injustice creates both vulnerability and resistance. Every interaction should emphasize the human cost of the city's prosperity while showcasing the resilience and determination of those who refuse to accept poisoning as the price of survival.

Adventures involving the Rusty Anchor should focus on worker solidarity, environmental justice, and the difficult choices between individual advancement and collective action. Characters must navigate a world where every comfort enjoyed by the elite is built on the suffering of contaminated workers, and where fighting for justice requires accepting personal risk and sacrifice.
