# The Rusty Anchor

## Overview
**Type:** Working-Class Tavern & Information Hub  
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]] ([[Port Zephyr]] - [[Harbor District]])  
**Population:** 50-80 patrons nightly, 10+ staff  
**Government:** Independent establishment under Harbor District oversight

## Description

The Rusty Anchor serves as both refuge and community center for [[Port Zephyr]]'s contaminated workers—dock laborers, sailors, and industrial workers who cannot afford the clean establishments in higher districts. Built from salvaged ship timbers with walls showing the distinctive discoloration of remnant magic exposure, the three-story building embodies working-class resilience in the face of systematic environmental oppression.

**[[One-Eyed Jack]]** operates the tavern with pragmatic understanding that his clientele faces daily choices between starvation and slow poisoning. The establishment serves contaminated food and drink at prices workers can afford, while providing the only social space where those affected by remnant exposure can gather without judgment.

The main common room features mismatched furniture built for durability, walls lined with maritime salvage, and air thick with pipe smoke that helps mask the metallic taste of contaminated atmosphere. Workers share information about contamination levels, employment opportunities, and organize informal support networks for families dealing with exposure-related illness.

**Community function** extends beyond commerce—the Anchor operates as an information exchange where workers coordinate mutual aid, share safety warnings, and occasionally plan responses to particularly dangerous working conditions. The establishment's "no questions, no names, no problems" policy makes it a natural hub for discrete communication among those the city's prosperity depends upon but prefers to ignore.

**DM Note:** The Anchor serves as an informal resistance meeting point. One-Eyed Jack maintains connections to smuggling networks and may have information about government contamination policies. The hidden back room hosts meetings about worker organization and resistance activities.

**Quest Hook:** Jack might ask players to investigate why contamination levels in certain districts are increasing, or help organize protection for workers facing retaliation for safety complaints.
