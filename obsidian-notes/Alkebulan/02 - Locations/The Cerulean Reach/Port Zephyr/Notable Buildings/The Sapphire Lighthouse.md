# The Sapphire Lighthouse

## Overview
**Type:** Pre-Cataclysm Navigation Beacon & Containment Facility  
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]] ([[Port Zephyr]] - [[Hill Ward]])  
**Population:** 8-12 Keepers of the Light  
**Government:** Managed by Keepers under Council oversight

## Description

The Sapphire Lighthouse rises nearly 200 feet from the [[Hill Ward]]'s highest point, built from blue-white stone that seems to hold internal luminescence. This pre-Cataclysm structure serves as both navigation aid for ships threading contaminated waters and symbol of humanity's precarious relationship with forces beyond their understanding.

**[[Arcane Harbormaster Lyrian Tidecaller]]** leads the Keepers of the Light, who maintain the lighthouse through careful observation and ritualistic procedures they only partially comprehend. The Sapphire Light itself—a brilliant blue-white beam visible for miles—operates on complex cycles that recent disturbances have begun to disrupt, causing concern among those who understand the potential consequences.

The lighthouse's foundation extends deep into the hillside, connecting to subterranean systems whose original purpose remains classified. The structure demonstrates pre-Cataclysm engineering that exceeds current capabilities, with seamless stonework and integrated magical technologies that the Keepers maintain without fully understanding.

**Environmental effects** around the lighthouse create unusual stability in contamination patterns, contributing to the [[Hill Ward]]'s relative safety. However, this protective influence may be an unintended consequence of the structure's primary function rather than its original design purpose.

<!-- DM_START -->
**DM Note:** The lighthouse is actually a containment system preventing something catastrophic from escaping. Deep chambers house ancient machinery and potential disaster protocols. Some Keepers may be Remnant Keeper agents monitoring the containment systems.

**Secret:** Underground passages connect to other pre-Cataclysm facilities. The lighthouse's light cycles are becoming increasingly unstable, suggesting containment failure that could trigger regional catastrophe.

## Notes

The Sapphire Lighthouse is a 200-foot pre-Cataclysm tower that serves as both navigation beacon and research facility. The Keepers of the Light maintain the structure's complex systems while studying contamination patterns and weather conditions. The lighthouse houses archives, living quarters, and subterranean levels with ancient machinery that few fully understand.
