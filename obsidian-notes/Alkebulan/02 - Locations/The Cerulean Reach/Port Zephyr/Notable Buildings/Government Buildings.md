# Government Buildings

## Overview
**Type:** Administrative Complex & Contamination Management Center  
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]] ([[Port Zephyr]] - [[Hill Ward]])  
**Population:** 150+ officials, 200+ support staff  
**Government:** Plutocratic administration serving merchant princes

## Description

Port Zephyr's government buildings form an interconnected complex across the most prestigious section of the [[Hill Ward]], commanding views of the entire city and harbor. These civic structures house the administrative machinery maintaining the city's contamination-based economy while projecting an image of clean, efficient governance to visiting imperial representatives and foreign dignitaries.

The complex centers around **Zephyr's Spire** but includes specialized buildings housing different administrative functions: the Hall of Records maintaining legal documents that formalize worker exploitation, Treasury Chambers securing wealth extracted through contamination commerce, Diplomatic Quarters providing meeting spaces for imperial coordination, and the Justice Pavilion containing courtrooms that enforce contamination-based social hierarchy.

Connected by covered walkways and formal gardens, the architecture incorporates salvaged pre-Cataclysm materials chosen for both prestige and radiation resistance. Hidden beneath elegant stonework lies the infrastructure of systematic oppression: detention facilities for contamination refugees, monitoring systems tracking worker exposure levels, and communication networks coordinating with imperial intelligence.

The entire complex operates on the principle that effective governance requires complete isolation from policy consequences. Environmental protection systems maintain conditions exceeding pre-Cataclysm standards for officials while their decisions systematically expose workers to dangerous contamination levels.

<!-- DM_START -->
**DM Note:** Government archives contain evidence that contamination levels are deliberately maintained for economic control. Hidden research facilities conduct illegal experiments using workers as test subjects. Emergency protocols exist for mass population reduction if worker movements threaten elite control.

**Secret:** Advanced environmental cleanup technology exists that could eliminate contamination but would destroy the social hierarchy. Some officials secretly work with Remnant Keepers to prevent another Cataclysm.
