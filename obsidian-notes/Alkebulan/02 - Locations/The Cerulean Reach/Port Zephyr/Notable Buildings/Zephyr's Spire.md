# Zephyr's Spire

## Overview
**Type:** Government Tower & Contamination Control Center  
**Region:** [[The Cerulean Reach]] ([[Port Zephyr]] - [[Hill Ward]])  
**Population:** 25-30 government officials, 40+ support staff  
**Government:** Seat of the [[Council of Merchant Princes]]

## Description

The white limestone tower of Zephyr's Spire rises 150 feet above [[Port Zephyr]], its bronze dome gleaming like a beacon of prosperity built on carefully managed suffering. The structure incorporates a pre-Cataclysm foundation whose atmospheric processing systems maintain perfect air quality for the Council chambers while consuming enough power to light half the [[Harbor District]].

The building serves as both practical seat of government and powerful symbolâ€”the ruling merchant princes conducting business in clean air while their policies slowly poison the workers below. Council meetings occur in the circular chamber at the tower's heart, its panoramic windows providing commanding views of the contaminated districts where their decisions determine who lives and who dies.

**[[Kaia Sunweaver]]** leads council sessions from her office at the spire's apex. The tower's advanced environmental systems ensure government continuity even during severe contamination events, protecting officials while workers face exposure without protection.

<!-- DM_START -->
**DM Note:** The spire houses classified contamination policy centers where "acceptable" worker exposure levels are calculated. Imperial coordination suites maintain secure communication with [[The Amunrai Imperium]]. Sunweaver's true allegiance to the Remnant Keepers creates opportunities for player allies or enemies within government.

**Secret:** Pre-Cataclysm atmospheric processors could clean the entire city's air but would eliminate the contamination-based social hierarchy that maintains elite power.
