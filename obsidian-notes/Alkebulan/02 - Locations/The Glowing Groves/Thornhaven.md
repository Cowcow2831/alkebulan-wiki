# Thornhaven

## Overview
**Type:** Forest Elf Canopy City  
**Region:** [[The Glowing Groves]]  
**Population:** ~3,500 (60% in canopy, 40% ground-level workers)  
**Government:** Elder Council (Elf, Human, Dwarf, Halfling, Dragonborn)

## Description

<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Thornhaven clings to survival in the twisted canopy of ancient forest giants along the clean river delta deep within [[The Glowing Groves]]. The settlement has built a dark prosperity through monopolizing remnant-resistant tree sap while maintaining brutal social stratification - only the "fit" earn protection in the canopy while the weak face exile to the contaminated forest floor.

Built into trees over 200 feet tall that have been twisted by centuries of magical contamination, Thornhaven represents one of the few successful large-scale communities in the Glowing Groves' exclusion zone. The ancient trees display crystalline veins pulsing with remnant energy, their bark having developed unique filtering properties that produce the precious anti-contamination sap making survival possible in this wasteland.

The settlement's architecture flows with the living trees, incorporating woven wood structures connected by rope and branch bridges that span the canopy at multiple levels. The higher elevations house the community's elite in relative safety, while ground-level operations expose workers to dangerous contamination levels during sap harvesting and processing.

The clean river delta provides Thornhaven with its greatest strategic advantage - a source of pure water in a region where most water sources carry magical contamination. This resource, combined with the anti-remnant sap production, allows the settlement to maintain trade relationships with communities throughout [[The Glowing Groves]] and beyond.

<!-- DM_START -->
**DM Note:** Thornhaven's prosperity is built on systematic environmental apartheid disguised as meritocracy. The "trial system" is deliberately manipulated by [[The Amunrai Imperium|Imperial]] agents and Council corruption to maintain social control while ensuring a steady supply of expendable workers for contamination exposure.

**The Dark Reality:** Monthly trials determine who receives life-saving contamination protection, but outcomes are secretly determined by political loyalty rather than merit. Imperial agents manipulate results to eliminate potential dissidents while maintaining a facade of fair selection.

**Strategic Importance:** The settlement's clean water source is completely pure due to ancient [[Sundered Mountains]] purification technology - not just "cleaner" water. This makes Thornhaven invaluable for both contamination treatment and as a political leverage point for regional control.

## Notable Features

### **The Sacred Groves**
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Ancient contamination-filtering trees that produce the anti-remnant sap essential for survival in the Western Coast. These massive trees, some reaching 200+ feet in height, have crystalline veins running through their bark that pulse with magical energy while simultaneously filtering remnant contamination from their surroundings.
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_END -->

### **The River Delta**
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Crystal-clear mountain water channels that provide Thornhaven with its most precious resource: uncontaminated water. The delta's purity makes it invaluable for both daily survival and medical treatment of contamination exposure.
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_END -->

<!-- DM_START -->
**Hidden Truth:** The water is completely pure due to pre-Cataclysm purification technology still functioning in the [[Sundered Mountains]]. This level of purity could provide contamination treatment for thousands of people, but the Council keeps this secret to maintain political leverage.
<!-- DM_END -->

### **Elder's Circle**
Council chambers built into the crown of the Great Mother Tree, where the five-member Elder Council makes decisions affecting the entire settlement's survival and prosperity.

### **Descent Platforms**
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Ceremonial areas where community members deemed "unfit" during monthly trials are lowered to ground level, officially for temporary work assignments but often becoming permanent exile.
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_END -->

<!-- DM_START -->
**True Purpose:** Execution platforms disguised as work assignments. Most "descended" individuals face fatal contamination exposure within weeks, creating a systematic elimination process for political dissidents and unwanted community members.
<!-- DM_END -->

### **Canopy Architecture**
Sophisticated living-wood construction that integrates with the trees' natural growth, creating multi-level residential and commercial spaces connected by rope and branch bridges spanning the canopy.

### **The Sap Works**
Processing facilities built around active tap sites where contamination-resistant sap is extracted, refined, and prepared for local use and regional trade.

### **Worker Camps**
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Temporary ground-level shelters for harvesters and processors who handle the dangerous work of sap extraction and contamination exposure.
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_END -->

<!-- DM_START -->
**Reality:** Permanent housing for community members deemed expendable, designed with minimal protection from contamination to ensure workers remain dependent on Council-controlled sap treatments.
<!-- DM_END -->

### **The Exile Zones**
Contaminated forest areas where cast-out individuals attempt survival, often supported by underground networks and resistance movements.

## Regional Integration

<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Thornhaven serves as a crucial hub for trade and communication throughout [[The Glowing Groves]], providing contamination protection resources to scattered settlements while maintaining strategic control over clean water access. The settlement's elevated position and sap monopoly make it a natural focal point for regional politics and survival coordination.
<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_END -->

<!-- DM_START -->
**Regional Role:** Thornhaven demonstrates how environmental scarcity creates opportunities for both community cooperation and systematic exploitation. The settlement serves as a microcosm of [[The Glowing Groves]] survival strategies: mutual aid versus social Darwinism, community resilience versus individual protection, and environmental justice versus profitable contamination management.

**Imperial Strategy:** The Imperium uses Thornhaven as a model for controlled environmental apartheid, testing social control methods that could be applied across contaminated regions. The settlement's success in maintaining productivity through systematic worker expendability provides a template for Imperial expansion into environmental disaster zones.

**Campaign Themes:** Thornhaven forces players to confront whether community survival justifies systematic sacrifice of vulnerable members, how environmental protection should be distributed when resources are scarce, and whether gradual reform or revolutionary change can address institutional environmental injustice.

## Notes

<!-- DM_START -->
**Campaign Integration:** Thornhaven represents the campaign's core question about environmental justice: when survival resources are genuinely scarce, how should communities decide who gets protection and who faces contamination exposure? The settlement provides both positive examples of environmental cooperation and negative examples of environmental apartheid, forcing players to develop their own positions on distributive environmental justice.

**Player Moral Choices:** The settlement offers opportunities for players to support, reform, or overthrow the current system while confronting the reality that resource scarcity makes some form of rationing inevitable. Players must decide whether they support meritocratic selection, egalitarian distribution, or revolutionary restructuring of contamination protection access.

**Environmental Symbolism:** The descending sap taps represent accelerating environmental degradation despite technological solutions, while the trial system mirrors how environmental crises disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The settlement's vertical stratification literally embodies environmental apartheid - the wealthy live above contamination while workers suffer exposure.
