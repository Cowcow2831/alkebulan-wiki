## Physical Description
The Sundered Mountains form one of Alkebulan's most striking geographical features - a vast mountain range literally torn apart by the magical cataclysm. Massive gaps separate sections of the range, with some peaks floating entirely free of the earth. The mountains are characterized by:

- Sheer cliffs of exposed crystal and raw remnant magic
- Floating rock formations ranging from boulder-sized to entire mountainsides
- Mysterious antigravity zones where physics behave unpredictably
- Deep chasms that pulse with residual magical energy
- Naturally occurring bridges of crystallized magic connecting various peaks
- Valleys where time flows differently than the surrounding areas

## Climate and Environment
The Sundered Mountains create several distinct microclimates:

### High Peaks
- Perpetual snow caps despite the tropical latitude
- Sudden magical storms that can alter weather instantly
- Pockets of preserved pre-cataclysm atmosphere

### Middle Slopes
- Dense forests warped by remnant magic
- Crystal formations that respond to moonlight
- Valleys where magical plants grow in impossible conditions

### Lower Regions
- Rich mineral deposits exposed by the sundering
- Hot springs with healing or transformative properties
- Cave systems that sometimes lead to pocket dimensions

## Flora and Fauna
The unique conditions have led to specialized adaptations:

### Notable Species
- Crystal Cacti colonies that store and redirect magical energy
- Floating herds of Thunderhoof Gazelles that leap between peaks
- Stone Eagles - massive birds that can phase through solid rock
- Cave-dwelling creatures that have evolved to manipulate remnant magic
- Gravity-defying plant life that grows in any direction

## Settlements and Culture

### Mountain Communities
- Isolated villages built into floating rock faces
- Monasteries dedicated to studying the mountains' mysteries
- Mining settlements extracting rare magical crystals
- Nomadic groups that follow the floating peaks' movements

### Notable Locations
- The Void Monastery: A sanctuary built in a perpetual antigravity zone
- Crystal Haven: A town famous for harvesting and working with magical crystals
- The Drifting Markets: Trading posts that move with the floating peaks
- The Echo Caves: A network of caverns where past sounds and events replay

## Resources and Trade

### Mining
- Remnant-touched crystals used in magical devices
- Rare metals with unique magical properties
- Stone imbued with levitation properties

### Other Resources
- Medicinal plants that only grow in altered gravity
- Crystal formations used in high-end magical implements
- Preserved artifacts from pre-cataclysm ruins

## Dangers and Challenges

### Natural Hazards
- Unpredictable gravity fluctuations
- Sudden magical storms that can alter reality
- Unstable floating formations that may collapse
- Time distortion zones that trap unwary travelers

### Magical Phenomena
- Random surges of wild magic
- Spatial distortions that create impossible geometry
- Temporary portals to other locations
- Echo zones where past events physically manifest

## Significance

### Historical Importance
- Site of major battles during the cataclysm
- Location of numerous pre-cataclysm ruins
- Source of powerful magical resources

### Current Role

- Magically stabilized bridges between peaks
- Skyship routes through relatively stable areas
- Secret paths known only to mountain guides

### Navigation Challenges
- Constantly shifting landscape
- Magnetic and magical interference
- Time distortions affecting journey duration
- Need for specialized guides who understand the mountains' patterns
