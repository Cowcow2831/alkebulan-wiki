# The Pre-Cataclysm Empires of Alkebulan

## Overview of the Ancient World

Before the Great Sundering, Alkebulan was dominated by two magnificent empires whose mastery of magic and technology far exceeded anything seen in the modern world. These civilizations achieved feats that current inhabitants can barely comprehend: cities that floated in the sky, rivers that flowed uphill, deserts transformed into gardens overnight, and magical constructs that could reshape entire landscapes.
