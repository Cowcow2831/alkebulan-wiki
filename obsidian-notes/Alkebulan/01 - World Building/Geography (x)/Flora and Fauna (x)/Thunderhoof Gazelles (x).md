# Thunderhoof Gazelles

## Basic Info
**Type:** Beast (magical)
**Size:** Medium
**Habitat:** Deserts, [[The Whispering Wastes]]
**Challenge Rating:** 2 (single), 5 (herd)
**Conservation Status:** Stable (some regional decline)

## Description

Slightly larger than normal gazelles, standing about 4-5 feet tall at the shoulder. Sleek bodies with a metallic sheen to their coat, often in shades of bronze or copper. Their spiraled horns crackle with small arcs of electricity, and their hooves emit a soft blue glow, leaving temporary sparking imprints when they run. Males display more pronounced electrical patterns along their flanks during mating season.

## Behavior
**Social Structure:** Herds of 20-50 individuals led by an alpha pair
**Diet:** Herbivorous, prefer remnant-touched grasses and shrubs
**Activity Pattern:** Graze at dawn and dusk, migrate following storm patterns
**Communication:** Electrical pulses combined with traditional gazelle calls

## Magical Properties
- Generate and channel electrical energy while running
- Can release bursts of thunder and lightning when threatened
- Influence local weather patterns, sometimes causing thunderstorms
- Absorb lightning strikes harmlessly during storms
- Can perform short-range teleportation during lightning strikes ("riding the thunder")

## Ecological Role
- Distribute and regulate magical energy across grasslands through grazing
- Stimulate growth in remnant-touched plants with their thunderous gallops
- Serve as natural lightning rods, protecting other species during storms
- Key prey species for predators adapted to electrical defenses

## Cultural Significance
**Symbolism:** Freedom, speed, raw power of nature, storm omens
**Economic Value:** Horns for lightning weapons, hide for electrical resistance gear
**Interaction with Civilized Races:** Wary due to hunting pressure

## Variants & Subspecies
- **Storm Gazelles:** Enhanced electrical abilities, thrive in perpetual storm regions
- **Silence Gazelles:** Rare sound-absorbing variant instead of electrical generation
- **Void Touched:** Extremely rare dark energy variant, considered omens

## Game Statistics
**Speed:** 60 feet (can dash as bonus action when electrically charged)
**Key Abilities:** High Dex/Con, Pack Tactics, Electric Aura
**Special Traits:** Thunder Step (1/day), Electrical Immunity, Spark Trail
**Immunities/Resistances:** Immune to lightning, resistant to thunder

## Harvesting & Materials
- **Horns:** Lightning weapon components, magical wands
- **Hide:** Electrical resistance armor when properly treated
- **Blood:** Speed potions, lightning resistance elixirs
- **Hooves:** Electric lamp fuel, storm warning device powder

## Adventure Hooks
- **The Silent Herd:** Mysteriously quiet herd investigation reveals magical plague
- **Storm Chasers:** Follow migrating herd to reach hidden location before rivals
- **Lightning Roads:** Ancient paths marked by hoofprints lead to forgotten sites
- **The Great Stampede:** Climate changes force multiple herds to converge, threatening settlements
