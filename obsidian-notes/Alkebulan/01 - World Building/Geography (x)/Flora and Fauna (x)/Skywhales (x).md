1. Appearance:
    - Colossal creatures, ranging from 100 to 300 feet in length.
    - Bodies resembling Earth whales but with ethereal, semi-transparent skin that shifts colors based on their mood and surrounding magical currents.
    - Multiple sets of fin-like appendages that seem to "swim" through the air.
    - Bioluminescent patterns across their bodies, brightest during mating season or when agitated.
2. Habitat:
    - Primarily inhabit the upper atmosphere of Alkebulan, occasionally descending to lower altitudes.
    - Often found near magical convergences or remnant-rich areas in the sky.
3. Magical Properties:
    - Possess a unique organ called the "Aetheric Sac" that allows them to manipulate gravity and air currents.
    - Their skin naturally absorbs and processes ambient magical energy, allowing them to "feed" on remnant magic.
4. Skyship Connection:
    - The Aetheric Sac, when properly processed, is a crucial component in skyship levitation systems.
    - Skywhale oil, derived from their blubber, is used to treat skyship hulls, providing magical protection and enhancing buoyancy.
5. Amunrai Imperium Control:
    - The Imperium closely guards the secrets of skywhale hunting and processing.
    - They maintain a monopoly on skyship production through their control of skywhale resources.
    - Strict laws prohibit unauthorized hunting or study of skywhales.
6. Hunting Practices:
    - Specialized skyships equipped with harpoons enchanted to pierce the skywhales' magical defenses.
    - Hunts are dangerous, often resulting in the loss of ships and crew.
    - The Imperium trains elite "Skywhale Hunters" who are sworn to secrecy.
7. Ecological Impact:
    - Skywhales play a crucial role in regulating atmospheric magic and weather patterns.
    - Overhunting has led to increased magical instability in some regions.
8. Cultural Significance:
    - Revered by many cultures as sacred beings, leading to conflicts with the Imperium's practices.
    - Some believe skywhales to be sentient and capable of communicating through dreams or visions.
9. Interference with Skyships:
    - Migrating pods can disrupt trade routes, forcing ships to take longer, more dangerous paths.
    - Aggressive or wounded skywhales may attack ships, mistaking them for predators.
    - Their massive bodies can create unpredictable air currents, challenging even skilled skyship pilots.
10. Black Market:
    - A thriving underground market exists for skywhale products, threatening the Imperium's monopoly.
    - Rebel factions and independent nations seek to develop their own skyship fleets using poached skywhale materials.
11. Conservation Efforts:
    - Some groups, including rogue Remnant Keepers, work to protect skywhales and find alternatives for skyship technology.
    - Rumors persist of "skywhale sanctuaries" hidden in remote, magically-cloaked areas of the sky.
12. Unique Variants:
    - Storm Callers: Rare skywhales that can influence weather patterns, creating or dissipating storms.
    - Void Swimmers: A mysterious deep-sky variant that can traverse the boundaries between planes.
