Alkebulan is a vast, diverse continent shaped by a tumultuous past. Centuries ago, two mighty empires clashed in a devastating magical war, resulting in a cataclysm that reshaped the land and drastically reduced the prevalence of magic. In the aftermath, smaller kingdoms and societies emerged from the ashes, struggling to rebuild in a world forever changed.

Now, generations later, [[The Amunrai Imperium (x)]] based in the region analogous to Egypt has risen to prominence. This new power seeks to expand its influence across the continent, filling the vacuum left by the fallen empires. Their ambitions of domination, however, are not unopposed.

A clandestine organization, [[The Remnant Keepers (x)]], composed of individuals who retain knowledge from the pre-cataclysm era, works from the shadows. Their goal is to maintain a balance of power, preventing any single entity from achieving the level of dominance that led to the ancient disaster.

Alkebulan is now a low-magic setting, where the remnants of once-great magical knowledge are rare and coveted. The continent's diverse landscapes, from scorching deserts to lush jungles and towering mountains, are home to various cultures and peoples, each adapting to the new world order in their own way.
