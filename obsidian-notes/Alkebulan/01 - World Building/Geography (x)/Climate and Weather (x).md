# Climate and Weather in Alkebulan

## Continental Overview

Alkebulan's climate system is a complex interaction between natural weather patterns and magical remnant energy left by the Cataclysm. The continent experiences both predictable seasonal cycles and unpredictable magical weather phenomena that can dramatically alter local conditions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for trade, travel, agriculture, and survival across the diverse landscapes.
