Remnant Magic in Alkebulan:
	   - The primary form of magic left after the cataclysm
	   - Manifests in unpredictable ways, often tied to locations or objects
	   - Users can tap into this ambient magic, but it's unreliable and potentially dangerous 
		   - A Wild Magic-like system that affects spellcasting
		   - Spellcasters can tap into residual magic for bonuses, but risk Wild Magic Surges

1. Nature of Remnant Magic:
   - Remnant Magic is the lingering power from a great magical cataclysm that reshaped Alkebulan.
   - It's unpredictable, powerful, and often dangerous if mishandled.
   - Remnant Magic is tied to artifacts, locations, and sometimes living beings that survived the cataclysm.

2. Accessing Remnant Magic:
   - Traditional spellcasting (Wizards, Sorcerers, etc.) is rare and often unreliable in Alkebulan.
   - Instead, magic users often channel Remnant Magic through artifacts or by tapping into magical locations.
   - This could be represented by a new class feature or feat called "Remnant Channeler."

3. Remnant Channeler Feature:
   - Allows a character to attune to Remnant artifacts more easily.
   - Grants the ability to cast certain spells by channeling nearby Remnant energy.
   - May come with risks, such as Wild Magic surges or temporary magical afflictions.

4. Remnant Artifacts:
   - These replace traditional magic items.
   - Each artifact has a primary function (like a +1 weapon) but also stores spell-like abilities.
   - Using an artifact's spells requires a successful Arcana check, with failure potentially triggering negative effects.

5. Remnant Locations:
   - Certain areas in Alkebulan have high concentrations of Remnant Magic.
   - Characters can attempt to draw power from these locations to cast spells or enhance their abilities.
   - This might require skill checks or saving throws to avoid magical backlash.

6. Magical Disciplines:
   - Divide Remnant Magic into disciplines based on the nature of the cataclysm, such as:
     - Chronomancy (time magic)
     - Biomancy (flesh-shaping magic)
     - Elementalism (control over primal forces)
     - Voidmancy (magic of space and dimensions)

7. Remnant-Touched Creatures:
   - Some creatures in Alkebulan have been altered by Remnant Magic.
   - This could create new monster variants with unpredictable magical abilities.
   - Players might gain temporary magical mutations after exposure to high levels of Remnant energy.

8. Remnant Magic and Classes:
   - Adapt existing classes to fit the Remnant Magic system:
     - Wizards become "Remnant Scholars" who study and decipher ancient magical texts.
     - Sorcerers are "Remnant-Touched" individuals with innate connections to the cataclysm's power.
     - Warlocks make pacts with powerful Remnant entities or artifacts instead of traditional patrons.

9. Magical Consequences:
   - Overuse of Remnant Magic might lead to magical corruption or addiction.
   - Implement a "Remnant Surge" table for critical successes or failures when using Remnant Magic.

10. The Role of Remnant Keepers:
    - This organization studies, contains, and sometimes utilizes dangerous Remnant Magic.
    - They might offer special training or abilities to player characters who join their ranks.
