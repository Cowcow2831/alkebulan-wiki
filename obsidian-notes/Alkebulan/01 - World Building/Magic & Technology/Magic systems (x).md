Magic Use in Society:
- Magic users are rare and often viewed with a mix of respect and suspicion
- Most people rely on non-magical solutions for daily life
- Magical education is limited and often secretive
- Some governments try to control or regulate magic use

Limitations:
- Powerful, instantaneous magic is extremely rare
- Most magic requires preparation, rituals, or specific conditions
- Overuse of magic can lead to physical or mental strain
- Some magical effects are temporary or have unintended consequences

Adjustments to align with 5e:

1. Spell Slots: Still used, but higher-level slots are rarer or require special conditions.
2. Cantrips: Remain unchanged, representing the basic magic that survived the cataclysm.
3. Ritual Casting: Emphasized more, allowing for powerful effects with preparation.
4. Magic Items: Rarer and often unpredictable, similar to minor artifacts.
5. Spellcasting Focus: Could include unique items like carved totems or remnants of the old empires.
6. Subclasses: Consider creating or reflavoring subclasses to fit Alkebulan's themes.
7. Feats: Introduce new feats that allow non-casters to access minor magical abilities.
8. Backgrounds: Create new backgrounds that grant limited magical abilities.
9. Rest and Recovery: Consider making long rests longer (perhaps a week) to limit magical resource recovery.
10. Wild Magic: Expand the Wild Magic system to occasionally affect all spellcasting.
This system provides a framework for limited but diverse magical practices in Alkebulan. It allows for interesting character options and plot devices while maintaining the low-magic feel of the setting.
