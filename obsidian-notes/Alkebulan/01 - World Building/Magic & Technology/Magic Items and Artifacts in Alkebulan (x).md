### Post-Cataclysm Reality
In Alkebulan's low-magic setting, traditional magic items are extremely rare. Most "magical" effects come from:
- **Remnant Artifacts**: Pre-Cataclysm items with unpredictable powers
- **Crafted Imitations**: Skillfully made mundane items that appear magical
- **Improvised Enchantments**: Temporary magical effects applied to normal items
- **Natural Phenomena**: Items that channel natural or Remnant magical energy

### Availability by Location
