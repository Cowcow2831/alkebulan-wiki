# Kaia Sunweaver

## Basic Info
**Race:** Dragonborn (Bronze heritage)
**Class/Occupation:** First Speaker of the Council of Merchant Princes / Secret Remnant Keeper Agent
**Faction:** Council of Merchant Princes (publicly), Remnant Keepers (secretly)
**Location:** [[Port Zephyr]] - [[Hill Ward]] ([[Zephyr's Spire]])
**Status:** Active
**Attitude toward party:** Professional, cautiously optimistic

## Description

Kaia stands tall even by dragonborn standards, her bronze-scaled skin bearing the patina of age and responsibility. Fine lines around her amber eyes speak to years of careful negotiation and measured decisions. She dresses in expertly tailored robes that blend Port Zephyr's mercantile fashion with subtle nods to ancient Remnant Keeper symbolism—geometric patterns that appear decorative but actually represent stability and balance.

Her office in Zephyr's Spire overlooks both the bustling harbor, a view she often contemplates during difficult decisions. When speaking publicly, her voice carries the authority of leadership, but in private conversations, those who listen carefully might hear the underlying passion of someone fighting for a greater cause.

## Personality
**Traits:** 
- Speaks in measured tones, weighing each word carefully before speaking
- Uses textile metaphors ("weaving solutions," "threads of consequence," "unraveling problems")
- Maintains perfect political composure but occasionally lets her guard down with trusted individuals

**Ideals:** 
- Stability and prosperity must be balanced with preventing another Cataclysm
- Leadership requires making difficult choices for the greater good
- Knowledge and artifacts should be preserved, not exploited for short-term gain

**Bonds:** 
- Deeply committed to Port Zephyr's independence and prosperity
- Secret allegiance to Remnant Keeper principles of magical stability
- Feels responsible for protecting her people from both Imperium expansion and magical dangers

**Flaws:** 
- Struggles with the burden of maintaining her secret identity
- Sometimes too cautious, missing opportunities while calculating risks
- Tends to manipulate situations rather than being direct, even when honesty might be better

## What My Character Knows
- **Public Knowledge**: Port Zephyr's trade relationships, political tensions with the Imperium, regional economic conditions
- **Political Intelligence**: Which Council members can be trusted, Imperium expansion strategies, other cities' positions on independence
- **Secret Remnant Keeper Knowledge**: Locations of dangerous artifacts, signs of magical instability, other Keeper agents in the region
- **About the Prism**: Recognizes it as a Solarian chronographer's tool, knows it could be dangerous if misused, suspects it might be creating magical instabilities

## Interactions
### [[Lvl 6 Whispers of the Wastes]]
#### Initial Meeting (The Gilded Zephyr)
- Approaches the party during dinner, presenting as a concerned political leader
- Tests the party's competence with careful questions about their experience
- Offers the job with professional courtesy but watches for signs of Imperium sympathy or reckless artifact hunting

#### Key Dialogue Hooks
- **"The Whispering Wastes hold many secrets. I trust you understand the importance of... discretion... when dealing with remnants of the old world?"**
- **"Port Zephyr thrives because we respect both profit and prudence. The caravan's cargo included items of historical significance."**
- **"I've heard the Imperium has been showing interest in our eastern trade routes. Coincidence, I'm sure."**

#### If Party Shows Keeper Sympathies
- Gradually becomes more open about her concerns regarding magical stability
- May hint at her deeper knowledge without fully revealing her affiliation
- Could become a long-term ally and contact

#### If Party Shows Imperium Sympathies
- Remains professionally courteous but becomes more guarded
- Focuses on payment and legal obligations rather than larger implications
- May arrange for discrete monitoring of the party's activities

## Plot Relevance

### In "Whispers of the Wastes"
**Primary Role**: Quest giver who represents the tension between immediate political needs and long-term magical stability.

**Hidden Agenda**: While she genuinely wants the Prism recovered, she's more concerned about preventing it from falling into Imperium hands or being misused by artifact hunters. She would prefer the party find a way to secure or neutralize the artifact rather than simply bringing it back to Port Zephyr.

**Negotiation Points**:
- **If party wants to keep Prism**: "Perhaps there are... alternative arrangements... that would serve everyone's interests."
- **If party wants to preserve the crystal garden**: "Stability has value beyond gold. We could discuss research partnerships."
- **If Imperium gets involved**: "Port Zephyr cannot officially take sides, but we remember our friends."

### Payment Flexibility
- **Full Success (Prism recovered)**: 1,000 gp as promised
- **Partial Success (Garden preserved)**: 500 gp + future considerations/contacts
- **Diplomatic Solution**: 750 gp + Remnant Keeper alliance benefits
- **Prevents Imperium acquisition**: Bonus 250 gp (presented as "discretionary civic improvement fund")

### Future Campaign Hooks
- Recruits party for other Keeper-related missions
- Provides intelligence about Imperium activities
- Offers Port Zephyr as a safe haven for party operations
- Could be a source of information about other dangerous artifacts

## Secret Keeper Activities

### How She Maintains Cover
- Uses her textile business to move Keeper agents and information
- Frames Keeper activities as "preserving Port Zephyr's cultural heritage"
- Coordinates with other Keeper agents through encrypted trade correspondence
- Maintains a small collection of "historical artifacts" (actually secured dangerous items)

### Signs of Her True Allegiance
- Office contains books on pre-Cataclysm history beyond what a politician would need
- Geometric patterns in her clothing and office decorations
- Occasionally uses Keeper terminology or concepts in conversation
- Shows unusual knowledge about magical dangers and artifacts

### Other Keeper Contacts
- **[[Master Appraiser Zara Gemheart]]**: Fellow agent who identifies dangerous artifacts in the markets
- **Various textile merchants**: Couriers who carry Keeper communications
- **Academic contacts**: Researchers who help analyze discovered artifacts

## Notes

### Roleplay Guidelines
- **Public Persona**: Professional, diplomatic, focused on Port Zephyr's interests
- **Private Conversations**: More passionate about preventing magical disasters
- **Under Pressure**: Reveals deeper concerns about stability and responsibility
- **If Discovered**: Would neither confirm nor deny but might become more open with trustworthy parties

### Character Arc Potential
Kaia represents the challenge of serving multiple masters—her city, her secret organization, and her personal conscience. Her story could develop into:
- A trusted patron for ongoing adventures
- A political ally in conflicts with the Imperium
- A mentor figure for characters interested in magical stability
- A tragic figure forced to choose between her various loyalties

### Adventure Integration
In this specific adventure, Kaia serves as more than a simple quest giver. She represents the complex political and magical realities of the post-Cataclysm world, where simple solutions rarely exist and every choice has far-reaching consequences. Her reaction to the party's decisions will help establish the tone for future adventures in this setting.
