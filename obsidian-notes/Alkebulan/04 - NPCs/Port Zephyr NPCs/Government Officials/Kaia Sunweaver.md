## Description

Kaia stands tall even by dragonborn standards, her bronze-scaled skin bearing the patina of age and responsibility. Fine lines around her amber eyes speak to years of careful negotiation and measured decisions. She dresses in expertly tailored robes that blend [[Port Zephyr]]'s mercantile fashion with subtle geometric patterns that appear purely decorative.

Her office in [[Zephyr's Spire]] overlooks both the bustling [[Harbor District]] and the eastern approaches to the city—a view she often contemplates during difficult decisions.

## Hidden Truth: Secret [[Remnant Keepers]] Agent

**Real Allegiance:** [[Remnant Keepers]] (for 8 years, recruited after discovering contaminated artifacts in trade shipments)

**True Mission:** Prevent another Cataclysm by monitoring and containing dangerous magical artifacts while maintaining Port Zephyr as a buffer against Imperial expansion

**Cover Maintenance:**
- Uses textile business to move Keeper agents and information throughout region
- Frames Keeper activities as "preserving Port Zephyr's cultural heritage"  
- Coordinates with other agents through encrypted trade correspondence
- Maintains private collection of "secured" dangerous artifacts

**Internal Conflict:** Genuinely cares about Port Zephyr's prosperity but knows preventing another Cataclysm must take priority. Sometimes these loyalties conflict, creating moral tension.

## Secret Knowledge

- Recognizes it as pre-Cataclysm temporal manipulation artifact
- Knows it's incredibly dangerous if misused—could trigger regional temporal instabilities
- Understands that [[The Amunrai Imperium]] wants it for weapons research
- Aware that using it for healing creates hidden temporal costs

**About Regional Threats:**
- [[The Amunrai Imperium]] has been systematically collecting temporal artifacts
- Other dangerous pre-Cataclysm weapons scattered throughout [[The Cerulean Reach]]
- Imperial agents embedded throughout Port Zephyr's government and merchant networks
- Signs of increasing magical instability in contaminated zones

**[[Remnant Keepers]] Network:**
- **[[Master Appraiser Zara Gemheart]]:** Fellow agent who identifies artifacts in Grand Bazaar
- **Textile merchant contacts:** Couriers throughout regional trading network
- **Academic researchers:** Scholars who analyze dangerous discoveries
- **Safe house operators:** Hidden locations for artifact containment

## "[[Lvl 6 Whispers of the Wastes]]" Integration

### The Real Job Briefing

**Public Story:** "Three days ago, a caravan carrying valuable crystalline goods for my district's infrastructure went missing in [[The Whispering Wastes]]. The loss represents 5,000 gold pieces and threatens my district's water purification project. I need discrete professionals to recover a specific artifact—a crystal called the [[Prism of Echoes]]—before my imperial business partners seek alternative suppliers."

**Hidden Truth:** The caravan was Imperial transport carrying the Prism to weapons research facility in [[Sundered Mountains]]. Kaia intercepted shipping intelligence and hired local "bandits" to stage the theft, but the plan went wrong when the artifact's containment failed. Now she needs the party to secure it before Imperial recovery teams arrive.

**Real Objective Hierarchy:**
1. **Prevent Imperial acquisition** of temporal weapon
2. **Contain or neutralize** the artifact's dangerous effects  
3. **Protect civilian population** from temporal contamination
4. **Maintain Port Zephyr's independence** and her cover identity

### Key Dialogue (Hidden Meaning)

**Opening:** *"I need discrete professionals to recover a specific artifact... before my imperial business partners seek alternative suppliers."*
- **Surface:** Concerned about business relationships
- **Reality:** Warning that Imperial forces are mobilizing

**Assessment:** *"The Whispering Wastes hold many secrets. I trust you understand the importance of... discretion... when dealing with remnants of the old world?"*
- **Surface:** Asking for professional discretion
- **Reality:** Testing if party understands magical dangers

**Hint:** *"The caravan's cargo included items of historical significance that shouldn't fall into the wrong hands."*
- **Surface:** Valuable antiques
- **Reality:** Dangerous pre-Cataclysm weapons

### Flexible Payment Structure

**Standard Success (Prism recovered):** 1,000 gp as promised

**Alternative Outcomes:**
- **Artifact contained safely:** 500 gp + [[Remnant Keepers]] alliance access
- **Imperial forces prevented:** +250 gp bonus ("civic improvement fund")  
- **Temporal contamination cleaned up:** +150 gp ("environmental services")
- **Evidence of Imperial weapons program:** Major [[Remnant Keepers]] rewards

**If Party Discovers Her Secret:**
- **Hostile response:** Maintains cover, distances herself politically
- **Neutral response:** Neither confirms nor denies, increases caution
- **Positive response:** Potential long-term alliance and Keeper recruitment

## Signs of Hidden Allegiance

**Physical Evidence:**
- Office contains pre-Cataclysm historical texts beyond political necessity

## DM Guidance

### Presenting Kaia's Complexity

- **Personal Moments:** Shows internal conflict between various loyalties
- **Crisis Response:** True priorities emerge under pressure

### Revelation Timing
- 

### Moral Weight
Kaia represents the challenge of doing good work through imperfect institutions. She's neither saint nor villain—she's someone trying to prevent catastrophe while maintaining the political position that allows her to be effective. Her story should emphasize that environmental protection often requires personal moral compromise and that individual heroes need institutional allies to create lasting change.

*Note: Kaia embodies the campaign's core theme that preventing environmental catastrophe requires working within flawed systems while maintaining moral clarity about what actually matters—community protection over individual advancement, long-term sustainability over short-term profit, and collective welfare over institutional loyalty.*
