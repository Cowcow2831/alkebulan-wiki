Traits:
Cunning Action: On each of her turns, Whisper can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

Mist Form (1/day): As an action, Whisper can transform into a misty shape for up to 1 minute. While in this form, she has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Sneak Attack (1/Turn): Whisper deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Whisper that isn't incapacitated and Whisper doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Actions:
Multiattack: Whisper makes two melee attacks.

Shortsword: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

Dagger: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

Hand Crossbow: Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

Mistborn Illusion (2/day): Whisper casts the Minor Illusion cantrip.

Reactions:
Uncanny Dodge: When an attacker that Whisper can see hits her with an attack, she can use her reaction to halve the attack's damage against her.

Remember, in the context of "The Mist Walker's Gambit," Whisper's goal is likely to avoid direct confrontation and escape with the artifact, so she'll use her abilities strategically to evade rather than engage in prolonged combat.
