## DM Overview

### Core Concept
Players must recover the [[Prism of Echoes]], a dangerous temporal artifact, before [[The Amunrai Imperium (x)]] can weaponize it. The adventure explores the moral complexity of temporal manipulation - every magical solution creates new problems elsewhere in the timeline.

### Key Themes
- **Environmental Contamination:** Magical radiation paralleling nuclear fallout
- **Temporal Ethics:** Healing in the present creates suffering in the future
- **Institutional Corruption:** Imperial forces legitimizing theft for "research"
- **Community Resilience:** Local leader secretly working to protect her people

### The Three Impossible Choices
1. **Deliver to [[Kaia Sunweaver]]:** Save contaminated children now, create hidden temporal debt
2. **Destroy the Prism:** End temporal manipulation forever, trigger massive cascade of suffering
3. **Contain the Artifact:** Create neutral research site, require permanent guardians

**Note:** No choice is "correct" - every option has genuine moral costs.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: Desert Journey (60-90 minutes)
- **Goal:** Track the missing caravan across contaminated wasteland
- **Encounters:** [[Thunderhoof Gazelles]], Imperial patrol, [[Spectral Whisps]]
- **Themes:** Environmental danger, Imperial pressure, ecosystem breakdown

### Act 2: The Lost Caravan (90-120 minutes)
- **Goal:** Investigate crystallized caravan site and understand the artifact
- **Key NPC:** [[Ashira the Sandshaper]] - temporal exile who explains the stakes
- **Challenge:** Navigate crystal garden, face environmental hazards
- **Revelation:** The Prism's true nature as temporal parasite

### Act 3: The Choice (60-90 minutes)
- **Goal:** Decide fate of the artifact under pressure
- **Complications:** Imperial forces, temporal storm, moral complexity
- **Resolution:** Face immediate consequences of choice
- **Aftermath:** Long-term implications for campaign world

## Key NPCs

### [[Kaia Sunweaver]]
**Public Identity:** Corrupt First Speaker seeking "infrastructure materials"  
**Secret Identity:** [[The Remnant Keepers (x)]] agent preventing temporal weaponization  
**Goal:** Obtain Prism to heal contaminated children in her district  
**Hidden Cost:** Creates equivalent contamination elsewhere/elsewhen

### [[Ashira the Sandshaper]]
**Status:** Temporal exile, partially crystallized  
**Knowledge:** Understands temporal debt mechanism  
**Role:** Explains the true horror of temporal manipulation  
**Condition:** Exists across multiple timeline fragments simultaneously

### Captain Thane Goldspear
**Role:** Imperial recovery team leader  
**Belief:** Legitimately recovering stolen Imperial property  
**Orders:** Transport artifact to mountain research facility  
**Hidden Agenda:** Imperial weaponization program

## Adventure Scaling

### For Investigation-Focused Groups
- Expand revelation scenes with detailed temporal mechanics
- More crystallized NPCs with different perspectives
- Additional research elements about pre-Cataclysm history

### For Combat-Focused Groups
- More crystal guardians and environmental hazards
- Dynamic crystal garden that changes during combat
- Imperial reinforcements creating ongoing military threat

### For Roleplay-Focused Groups
- Extended faction negotiations and moral philosophy
- Personal stakes through NPCs with contaminated family
- Character development focused on belief changes

### Time Management
- **Compress travel** if players want main conflict
- **Extend choice phase** if players engage with ethics
- **Flexible encounters** based on group energy
- **Clear consequences** regardless of time pressure

## Contamination Mechanics

### Exposure Levels
1. **Mild:** Hair loss, nausea
2. **Moderate:** Crystal growths, Constitution disadvantage
3. **Severe:** Speed reduction, necrotic vulnerability
4. **Critical:** Max HP halved
5. **Extreme:** All checks at disadvantage
6. **Terminal:** Crystallization (incapacitated, dying)

### Treatment
- **Lesser Restoration:** -1 contamination level
- **Greater Restoration:** -2 contamination levels
- **Natural Recovery:** -1 level per week in clean environment

## Temporal Debt Explained

### The Mechanism
The [[Prism of Echoes]] heals by stealing equivalent life force from random points in the timeline. Heal contamination today, someone suffers identical poisoning in the past or future.

### Why It's Horrifying
- Victims are chosen randomly across all time
- No way to predict or prevent the suffering
- Each use makes temporal debt more likely to cascade
- Universe demands perfect balance - the debt is always paid

### Imperial Weaponization Plan
Force temporal debt onto enemy populations during warfare, essentially using time itself as a weapon against civilian targets.

## Post-Nuclear Themes

### Environmental Parallels
- **Magical Contamination = Radiation:** Invisible, persistent, generational
- **Crystal Gardens = Dead Zones:** Beautiful but deadly contaminated areas
- **Remnant Energy = Fallout:** Long-term environmental damage

### Social Commentary
- **Corporate Extraction:** Empire treats colonies as resource sources
- **Environmental Justice:** Poor communities bear contamination costs
- **Institutional Betrayal:** Governments prioritize power over public safety
- **Community Resilience:** People must protect each other when institutions fail

## Campaign Integration

### One-Shot Conclusion
End with immediate consequences and hints of long-term effects:
- Show result of choice (healed children, spreading contamination, or contained threat)
- Reveal Kaia's true identity and mission
- Demonstrate the weight of temporal decisions

### Campaign Continuation Hooks
- **Imperial Retaliation:** Recovery teams seek "stolen" artifacts
- **Temporal Aftershocks:** Reality distortions spreading from the Wastes
- **Remnant Keeper Contact:** Invitation to join secret organization
- **Other Artifacts:** Similar temporal weapons discovered elsewhere

## Success Metrics

The adventure succeeds when:
- Players understand the stakes of temporal manipulation
- Every choice feels meaningful but costly
- Environmental themes resonate with modern concerns
- Characters face genuine moral uncertainty
- Imperial corruption feels believable and threatening
- Community resilience provides hope within darkness

**Remember:** This is dark but playable. Heroes matter and positive change is possible, but every victory requires sacrifice and constant vigilance.
