# Whispers of the Wastes - One-Shot Adventure (Level 6)

## Adventure Overview (4-6 Hours)
A focused one-shot where players must recover a dangerous temporal artifact before Imperial forces weaponize it. The adventure emphasizes moral choices about temporal manipulation and the cost of magical solutions.

## Pre-Game Setup (5 minutes)
- **Setting Brief:** [[Port Zephyr]], 300 years post-magical apocalypse
- **Character Connections:** All PCs have reason to work with/distrust corrupt politicians
- **Starting Location:** [[The Gilded Zephyr]] inn, evening meeting

## Hook & Briefing (15 minutes)

### Kaia's Business Proposal
**First Speaker [[Kaia Sunweaver (x)]]** approaches with what appears to be a corrupt business deal:

*"Three days ago, a caravan carrying valuable crystalline goods for my district's infrastructure went missing in [[The Whispering Wastes]]. The loss represents 5,000 gold pieces and threatens my district's water purification project. I need discrete professionals to recover a specific artifact—a crystal called the [[Prism of Echoes (x)]]—before my [[The Amunrai Imperium (x)|imperial (x)]] business partners seek alternative suppliers. 1,000 gold for its return, 500 for proof of its destruction if recovery proves impossible."*

**Hidden Truth:** She's a secret [[The Remnant Keepers (x)|Remnant Keepers (x)]] trying to prevent Imperial weaponization of a temporal artifact.

## [[Act 2 - The Lost Caravan - Whispers of the Wastes|Act 2 - The Lost Caravan]] (90-120 minutes)

### Initial Discovery (15 minutes)
Players find the crystallized caravan in a growing crystal garden:
- 5 wagons half-buried in crystalline formations
- 12 crystallized figures frozen in position
- The Prism of Echoes floating in the center, pulsing with power
- Crystal formations spreading in 300-foot radius

### Investigation Phase (30 minutes)
**What Players Can Learn:**
- **DC 12 Investigation:** Caravan was fleeing something, not traveling normally
- **DC 15 Arcana:** Energy signatures mixing temporal magic with Remnant contamination
- **DC 14 Medicine:** Crystallized figures are still alive but paralyzed
- **DC 16 History:** This matches descriptions of pre-Cataclysm temporal weapons

### Meeting Ashira (20 minutes)
**[[Ashira the Sandshaper (x)]]** emerges from partial crystallization:
- **Temporal Awareness:** She exists partially across multiple timelines
- **Critical Information:** Explains the Prism's true function
- **The Temporal Cost:** Healing in the present creates equivalent suffering in the future
- **Warning:** Imperial researchers plan to weaponize this principle

### The Crystal Garden Challenge (30 minutes)
**Environmental Hazards:**
- **Crystal Shards:** 2d6 piercing damage for careless movement
- **Spell Reflection:** Crystalline surfaces reflect magic unpredictably
- **Contamination Build-up:** Constitution saves or gain exhaustion

**Getting to the Prism:**
- **Force Approach:** Fight through 4 Animated Crystal Cacti
- **Stealth Approach:** Navigate carefully through crystal maze
- **Magic Approach:** Use spells to safely reach the center

### Imperial Arrival (15 minutes)
**Complication:** Imperial recovery team arrives during investigation

- **Negotiation Option:** Convince them you're retrieving it for lawful authority  
- **Combat Option:** Fight Imperial forces while dealing with crystal hazards
- **Stealth Option:** Hide until they leave, then act quickly

## [[Act 3 - The Choice - Whispers of the Wastes|Act 3 - The Choice]] (60-90 minutes)

### Understanding the Stakes (15 minutes)
Ashira explains the full horror of temporal debt:
- **Healing Use:** Save contaminated children now, cause equivalent contamination elsewhere/elsewhen
- **Weapon Use:** Imperial plan to force temporal debt onto enemy populations
- **Destruction Risk:** Might heal temporal wounds or create temporal cascade

### The Impossible Decision (30 minutes)
Players must choose between three options:

#### Option 1: Deliver to Kaia
- **Immediate:** Save Port Zephyr's contaminated children
- **Hidden Cost:** Equivalent suffering occurs randomly across timeline
- **Long-term:** Prism remains available for future use/abuse

#### Option 2: Destroy the Prism  
- **Immediate:** Temporal contamination spreads as artifact fails
- **Result:** All temporal debts come due at once—massive random suffering
- **Long-term:** No more temporal manipulation possible

#### Option 3: Attempt Containment
- **Requires:** Complex magical ritual (multiple skill checks)
- **Success:** Creates stable containment, artifact becomes research tool
- **Failure:** Temporal cascade affects entire region

### Final Confrontation (30 minutes)
**Temporal Storm:** Regardless of choice, the decision triggers magical chaos
- **Reality Fragments:** Brief glimpses of alternate outcomes
- **Environmental Effects:** Crystal formations react violently
- **Combat Complication:** If Imperial forces are present, fight during storm
- **Escape Sequence:** Getting out of the collapsing crystal garden

### Resolution (15 minutes)
**Immediate Consequences Based on Choice:**
- **Delivered:** Children healed, Kaia reveals Remnant Keeper identity, temporal debt unknown
- **Destroyed:** Contamination spreads, Ashira dies, Imperial threat ended
- **Contained:** New research site established, ongoing protection needed

## One-Shot Considerations

### Time Management
- **Streamlined Travel:** Use montage with 2-3 encounters max
- **Focused Investigation:** Clear clues leading to artifact location
- **Choice-Driven Climax:** Emphasize moral decision over complex combat
- **Quick Resolution:** Show immediate consequences, imply long-term effects

### Key NPCs (Minimal Prep)
- **Kaia:** Corrupt politician with secret heroic mission
- **Ashira:** Temporal exile who explains the stakes
- **Captain Thane:** Imperial officer who believes he's preventing theft

### Pre-Made Elements
- **Handout:** Map of the Whispering Wastes with caravan route
- **Reference:** Contamination effects table
- **Stat Blocks:** Imperial soldiers, Crystal Cacti, Spectral Whisps
- **Props:** Description cards for the crystallized caravan members

### Scaling Options
- **Easier:** Reduce Imperial forces, simplify environmental hazards
- **Harder:** Add more crystal guardians, increase contamination effects
- **Different Focus:** Emphasize investigation over combat, or vice versa

### Conclusion
This one-shot explores the core themes of environmental disaster and moral complexity without requiring extensive campaign setup. Players face a genuine moral dilemma where every choice has serious consequences, perfectly capturing the dark post-nuclear tone while remaining playable in a single session.

The temporal debt concept ensures that even "winning" comes with hidden costs—exactly the kind of pyrrhic victory that defines the setting's dark optimism.
