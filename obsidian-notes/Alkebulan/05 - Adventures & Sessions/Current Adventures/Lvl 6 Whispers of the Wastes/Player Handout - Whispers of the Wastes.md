# Player Handout - Whispers of the Wastes

## Welcome to Alkebulan

**Setting:** A dark fantasy continent recovering from magical apocalypse. Think "Chernobyl meets Lord of the Rings" - a world where magic caused a nuclear-scale disaster 300 years ago, and communities are still rebuilding from the contaminated ruins.

**Tone:** Dark but playable. Heroes matter, positive change is possible, but every victory has costs and safety requires constant vigilance.

## The World You Know

### The Cataclysm (300 Years Ago)
Two magical empires destroyed each other in catastrophic warfare using temporal weapons and reality-altering magic. The result: a shattered continent where remnant magical energy still poisons the land, mutates creatures, and makes magic unpredictable and dangerous.

### [[Port Zephyr]] - Your Starting Location
A desperate trading port clinging to survival as the last major hub in The Cerulean Reach. Ruled by the Council of Merchant Princes - an oligarchy where wealth determines who lives and dies. The city's 10,000 residents survive through:
- Arms dealing and trade in contaminated goods
- Exploiting labor in dangerous remnant zones
- Political corruption and economic manipulation

**Key Locations:**
- **[[Harbor District]]:** Contaminated docks, desperate workers
- **[[Merchant Quarter]]:** Where the wealthy isolate themselves from the poor
- **[[The Gilded Zephyr]]:** Where you'll receive your mission

### [[The Whispering Wastes]]
A contaminated desert east of [[Port Zephyr]] where remnant energy creates:
- **[[Spectral Whisps]]:** Ghostly entities that drift across the dunes
- **Crystal formations:** Dangerous but beautiful growths from magical contamination
- **Temporal anomalies:** Where time moves strangely
- **Mutation zones:** Where life adapts in disturbing ways

## Character Creation Guidelines

### Races
**All standard D&D races are welcome** with minor setting adjustments:

#### Recommended Races:
- **Humans:** Most common survivors, adaptable
- **Elves:** Long-lived witnesses to the Cataclysm
- **Dwarves:** Underground survivors, skilled crafters
- **Halflings:** Hardy communities that endured
- **Standard Tieflings/Dragonborn/etc.:** All work with minor lore tweaks

#### Setting-Specific Race: **Sandshapers**
*Post-Cataclysm desert dwellers*
- **ASI:** Constitution +2, Wisdom +1
- **Abilities:** Desert survival, earth magic (*mold earth* cantrip, *Earth Tremor* once per long rest), sand camouflage
- **Culture:** Nomadic tribes with deep respect for the desert

#### Consider Avoiding:
- Warforged, Changelings, Kalashtar (don't fit the setting tone)
- Highly technological or planar-focused races

### Classes & Subclasses
**All official classes work** in the setting.

### Backgrounds
Use standard D&D backgrounds with post-Cataclysm context:
- **Guild Artisan:** Crafting with scavenged materials
- **Hermit:** Surviving alone in contaminated zones
- **Soldier:** Fighting raiders and Imperial expansion
- **Scholar:** Preserving lost knowledge
- **Folk Hero:** Defending your community from threats

## Magic in Alkebulan

### Key Concepts:
- **Magic is rare and dangerous** - Spellcasters face social suspicion
- **Remnant contamination** - Magic can poison the user over time
- **Wild magic effects** - Spells sometimes have unexpected consequences
- **Ancient artifacts** - Pre-Cataclysm items are powerful but unstable

### Spell Considerations:
- **Desert survival spells** (*create water*, *endure elements*)
- **Investigation magic** (*detect magic*, *identify*)
- **Purification effects** (*purify food and drink*)
- **Communication spells** (for dangerous terrain)

---

## Important Factions

### [[Remnant Keepers]]
**Secret organization** studying the Cataclysm to prevent another one. They:
- Preserve dangerous knowledge
- Monitor magical threats
- Sometimes make morally questionable choices "for the greater good"

### [[The Amunrai Imperium]]
**Expanding solar empire** from the north threatening local independence:
- Egyptian-themed culture with solar magic
- Highly organized military and bureaucracy
- Views southerners as "primitives" needing civilization

### Local Authorities
**[[Port Zephyr]]'s Council of Merchant Princes:**
- Corrupt oligarchy prioritizing profit over people
- Each council member controls different aspects of city life
- May hire adventurers for jobs that benefit their interests

## Contamination Mechanics

Your characters understand that prolonged exposure to remnant energy causes **contamination** - treat it like exhaustion levels:

1. **Mild:** Hair loss, occasional nausea
2. **Moderate:** Visible crystal growths, Constitution save disadvantage
3. **Severe:** Speed reduced, vulnerability to necrotic damage
4. **Critical:** Hit points halved
5. **Extreme:** Disadvantage on all checks and saves
6. **Terminal:** Crystallization (incapacitated, dying)

**Treatment:**
- *Lesser restoration* removes 1 level
- *Greater restoration* removes 2 levels
- Natural recovery: 1 level per week in clean environment
