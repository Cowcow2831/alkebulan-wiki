# Act 1 - Desert Journey

## Setting the Scene

As the party leaves Port Zephyr's eastern gate, the lush coastal environment gradually gives way to an alien desert landscape. The Whispering Wastes earned their name from the constant, ethereal humming that fills the air - a sound produced by remnant energy manifesting as Spectral Whisps. These translucent, flowing entities drift across the dunes like ghostly ribbons, their movements creating haunting harmonies that speak of the magical disaster that created this wasteland.

## Environmental Features

### The Shifting Sands
- The desert floor constantly moves and changes, with dunes forming and collapsing in hours rather than days
- Areas of quicksand infused with remnant energy (glows faintly blue)
- Glass-like patches where remnant storms have fused the sand
- Dead vegetation crystallized by magical contamination

### The Whisping Winds
- Unusual wind patterns that seem to carry fragments of conversations from 300 years ago
- Occasional remnant-charged dust devils that temporarily disrupt magic
- Strategic use of the wind can mask sounds and tracks
- Winds carry contaminated particles requiring Constitution saves in heavy exposure

### Contamination Warning Signs
- Spectral Whisps gathering in large numbers
- Static electricity building in the air
- Sand taking on a purple or blue tinge
- Dead or mutated wildlife showing crystal growths

## Navigation Challenges

### Finding the Trail
- Initial DC 12 Survival check to pick up the caravan's trail
- Success reveals distinctive wheel tracks and crystalline residue from magical containment failure
- Additional checks every 2 hours or when changing direction

### Tracking Modifiers
- Clear day: Normal check
- Sandstorm: Disadvantage
- Following Whisp patterns: Advantage (they tend to flow toward remnant energy concentrations)
- Imperial interference: Disadvantage if scouts have disturbed the area

### Lost Procedures
If the party loses the trail:
1. Allow a DC 15 Survival check to reorient
2. Present a random encounter or Imperial patrol
3. Offer environmental clues (crystalline growths pointing toward the caravan)

## Detailed Encounters

### 1. Contaminated Thunderhoof Gazelles

- Show visions of the area's history and the caravan's passage

## Environmental Hazards

### 1. Contamination Exposure
- **Mild Exposure:** 1+ hours in contaminated areas requires DC 12 Constitution save
- **Heavy Exposure:** Direct contact with remnant energy sources, DC 15 Constitution save
- **Failed Saves:** Gain 1 level of contamination (treat as exhaustion levels)
- **Symptoms:** Hair loss, nausea, crystal growths under skin at higher levels

### 2. Crystallizing Sandstorms (how does this trigger?)
- **Detection:** DC 14 Perception to notice approaching storm
- **Duration:** 2d4 hours of reduced visibility and movement
- **Effects:** Constitution saves every hour (DC 13) or gain contamination
- **Shelter:** Reduces save DC to 10, but limits movement options

### 3. Memory Mirages (how does this trigger?)
- **Trigger:** Intense heat combined with remnant energy
- **Effect:** Illusory scenes from before the Cataclysm appear in distance
- **Recognition:** DC 12 Investigation to identify as mirages
- **Information:** May contain useful hints about the region's history

## Tracking Time and Resources

### Water and Food
- Each character needs 2 gallons of water per day (desert environment)
- Water sources in the Wastes are often contaminated
- **Purification:** *Purify food and drink* removes contamination
- **Crystal Cacti:** Can be harvested for emergency water (DC 12 Nature, potentially contaminated)

### Heat and Exhaustion
- Constitution saves every hour during peak heat (DC 13, +1 each hour)
- DC resets after short rest in shade
- Contamination levels make heat exhaustion more dangerous

### Travel Pace and Detection
- **Normal Pace:** 2 miles per hour, normal Perception
- **Slow Pace:** 1 mile per hour, advantage on Perception and Survival
- **Fast Pace:** 3 miles per hour, disadvantage on Perception, more likely to trigger encounters

## Contamination Effects Reference

### Contamination Levels (Like Exhaustion)
1. **Mild:** Hair loss, occasional nausea
2. **Moderate:** Visible crystal growths, disadvantage on Constitution saves  
3. **Severe:** Speed reduced by 10 feet, vulnerability to necrotic damage
4. **Critical:** Maximum hit points reduced by half
5. **Extreme:** Disadvantage on all ability checks and saves
6. **Terminal:** Character becomes crystallized (incapacitated, dying)

### Treatment Options
- **Lesser Restoration:** Reduces contamination by 1 level
- **Greater Restoration:** Reduces contamination by 2 levels  
- **Natural Recovery:** 1 level per week in clean environment
- **Magical Items:** Some artifacts can provide protection or treatment

## Optional Encounters (Time Permitting)

### 1. Remnant Researcher Camp
- **Setup:** Abandoned research camp with crystallized equipment
- **Investigation:** Reveals Imperial research into remnant energy
- **Hazard:** Unstable experiments create magical anomalies
- **Reward:** Research notes about contamination protection

### 2. Contaminated Oasis
- **Setup:** Water source that appears clean but tests as contaminated
- **Choice:** Use contaminated water or continue searching
- **Complication:** Other travelers have been using this source
- **Resolution:** Can be purified with magic, but takes time and resources

### 3. Crystal Garden Approach Signs
- **Setup:** Increasing crystal formations as party approaches caravan site
- **Warning:** Growing magical instability in the area
- **Navigation:** Requires careful route selection to avoid worst contamination
- **Foreshadowing:** Prepares players for the main crystal garden encounter

## Transitioning to Part 2
When the party has:
- Survived at least one major encounter
- Made sufficient progress tracking the caravan (successful Survival checks)
- Experienced the environmental dangers and contamination risks
- Had opportunity to interact with Imperial forces or avoid them

They discover the crystallized caravan site surrounded by an expanding garden of crystal formations, with the Prism of Echoes pulsing with temporal energy at its heart.
