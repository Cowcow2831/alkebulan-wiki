# Act 2 - The Lost Caravan - Whispers of the Wastes

<!-- PLAYER_SAFE_START -->
Cresting a large dune, the party discovers a haunting sight: five wagons half-buried in crystallized sand, surrounded by crystalline growths that pulse with inner light. The air thrums with unstable magical energy, and delicate crystal formations extend outward in a spiral pattern. At the center, a floating crystalline artifact casts shifting shadows that seem to show multiple moments in time simultaneously.

<!-- DM_START -->
## Initial Discovery

### The Caravan Site Overview
- 5 wagons arranged in defensive circle formation
- 12 crystallized figures frozen in various poses of flight and protection
- Cargo scattered and partially crystallized, including broken containment boxes
- Crystal formations growing through/around wagons in geometric patterns
- **Central artifact:** [[Prism of Echoes]] floating 5 feet above crystalline pedestal

### Investigation Opportunities

#### Basic Investigation (DC 12)
- Evidence of magical containment failure - broken crystal-lined boxes
- Crystallized figures positioned fleeing **toward** the Prism, not away
- Multiple waves of crystallization, suggesting repeated activation

#### Advanced Investigation 
- **DC 15 Arcana:** Energy signatures combining temporal magic with Remnant contamination
- **DC 16 History:** Patterns match theoretical pre-Cataclysm temporal artifacts
- **DC 18 Arcana:** Crystallization occurred in waves over time
- **DC 20 Investigation:** Carved warnings in multiple languages about "temporal debt"

#### Medical Analysis (DC 17)
Crystallized figures remain alive - hearts beat once per minute, consciousness trapped in crystal prison.

### The Crystallized Figures

#### Key Caravan Members
- **Merchant Captain:** Pointing toward broken containment, mouth open in warning
- **Guard Sergeant:** Frozen mid-sword draw, facing crystal garden heart
- **Caravan Healer:** Crystallized while tending injured companion
- **Pack Animals:** Horses and mules showing fear even in crystal state

#### Communication Attempts
- **Speak with Dead:** Functions but responses fragmented, focus on temporal warnings
- **Physical Contact:** Causes psychic feedback (1d6 psychic damage, DC 15 WIS save for memory flashes)
- **Breaking Crystal:** 3d6 psychic damage to both figure and rescuer

## The Crystal Garden

### Three Distinct Zones

#### Outer Ring (150-300ft from center)
- **Terrain:** Scattered crystal formations up to 6 feet tall
- **Movement:** Normal speed, DC 12 DEX saves to avoid shards (1d6 piercing)
- **Magic:** Spells function normally
- **Contamination:** Mild exposure risk after 30 minutes

#### Middle Ring (50-150ft from center)
- **Terrain:** Dense crystal maze creating narrow passages
- **Movement:** Speed halved, DC 14 DEX saves every 30 feet (2d6 piercing + entanglement)
- **Magic:** 10% spell reflection chance (d10: 1 reflects to random target)
- **Contamination:** Moderate exposure risk after 10 minutes
- **Navigation:** DC 15 Survival for optimal path

#### Inner Sanctum (0-50ft from center)
- **Terrain:** Perfect crystalline amphitheater formations
- **Movement:** Safe paths exist, DC 16 Perception to identify
- **Magic:** Unpredictable effects - roll on [[Whispering Wastes Surge Table]]
- **Contamination:** Heavy exposure risk immediately
- **Temporal Effects:** Past/future glimpses in crystal reflections

### The Heart: [[Prism of Echoes]]
- **Appearance:** Multifaceted crystal shifting between transparent/opaque
- **Temporal Resonance:** Shows glimpses of different time periods
- **Energy Pattern:** Pulses in rhythm with crystallized figures' heartbeats
- **Protective Field:** DC 18 Arcana to safely approach without triggering defenses

## Key Investigation Locations

### The Merchant's Wagon
- **Locked Strongbox (DC 15 Thieves' Tools):** Shipping manifest, payment records
- **Imperial Documentation:** Orders for "Class VII Temporal Research Material" transport
- **Personal Journal:** Final entry warns of containment failure and "time debt coming due"
- **Hidden Compartment:** Emergency protocols for temporal artifact containment breach

### Broken Containment System
- **Crystal-Lined Boxes:** Sophisticated Imperial magical technology
- **Failure Evidence:** Intentional opening from inside, not external force
- **Temporal Stabilizers:** Components designed to prevent time displacement
- **Warning Inscriptions:** "TEMPORAL MANIPULATION ARTIFACT - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"

### [[Ashira the Sandshaper]]'s Prison

#### Discovery
Found partially crystallized near the Prism, existing across multiple timeline fragments simultaneously.

#### Ashira's Condition
- **Physical:** Lower body crystallized, upper body shifting between different ages
- **Mental:** Lucid but experiencing past/present/future simultaneously
- **Communication:** Often responds to questions before they're asked
- **Temporal Anchoring:** Becoming increasingly unstable

#### Critical Information Ashira Provides
- **Prism Function:** Creates healing by stealing equivalent life force from future timeline
- **Disaster Cause:** Someone used Prism to heal injured companion, triggering cascade
- **Imperial Purpose:** Weaponize temporal debt principle against enemies
- **Temporal Cost:** Every use creates "debt" manifesting as suffering elsewhere/elsewhen
- **Resistance:** Artifact actively resists containment when sensing potential users

## Environmental Hazards

### Crystal Shard Storms
- **Trigger:** Loud noises, magical explosions, damage to major formations
- **Effect:** 2d6 piercing damage per round in affected area
- **Duration:** 3 rounds unless formation source destroyed
- **Protection:** Cover behind intact crystal provides immunity

### Spell Reflection Matrix
- **Chance:** 30% for targeted spells hitting crystalline surfaces
- **Effect:** Spell targets random creature within range
- **Prediction:** DC 15 Arcana to predict reflection angle
- **Mitigation:** Area effects less likely to reflect

### Temporal Echoes
- **Manifestation:** Brief glimpses of same area at different times
- **Effect:** DC 14 WIS save or stunned 1 round from temporal disorientation
- **Information:** May reveal past events or hint at future consequences
- **Frequency:** Increases approaching the Prism

### Progressive Crystallization
- **Mechanism:** Contamination levels increase while in garden
- **Save Frequency:** Every 10 minutes Inner Sanctum, 30 minutes Middle Ring
- **Progression:** Failed saves gain contamination levels
- **Reversal:** Moving away from center reduces progression rate

## Combat Encounters

### Crystal Garden Guardians
*Triggered when approaching Prism or damaging major formations*

#### Contaminated Crystal Cacti (4)
![[Crystal Cacti#Contaminated Crystal Cactus]]

#### Contaminated Crystal Sentinel (appears if cacti destroyed)
![[Crystal Cacti#Contaminated Crystal Sentinel]]

### Environmental Combat Complications
- **Difficult Terrain:** Crystal formations create maze-like battlefield
- **Spell Hazards:** Reflected spells hit random targets
- **Contamination Buildup:** Extended combat increases exposure
- **Temporal Anomalies:** Attacks occasionally hit targets from previous rounds

## Approaches to the Prism

### Method 1: Force Approach
- **Combat Route:** Fight through crystal guardians directly
- **Hazards:** All environmental dangers during combat
- **Time:** Fastest but highest risk
- **Consequence:** Destroys research value of formations

### Method 2: Stealth and Skill
- **Navigation:** Stealth, Acrobatics, Survival checks
- **DC Progression:** 12, 14, 16 through the rings
- **Advantage:** Avoid combat, preserve formations
- **Risk:** Failure triggers guardians and hazards

### Method 3: Magical Manipulation
- **Arcana Challenges:** Use magic to navigate safely
- **Requirements:** Protective wards, magical sight, dispelling
- **Benefit:** Gather more temporal effect information
- **Cost:** High spell slot expenditure, reflection risk

### Reaching the Prism
At the garden's heart, players must decide interaction method:
- **Direct Contact:** Triggers temporal visions, immediate understanding
- **Magical Analysis:** Reveals temporal debt mechanism safely
- **Ashira's Guidance:** Explains artifact nature and consequences
- **Attempted Removal:** Causes violent crystal garden reaction

## Complications and Timing

### Imperial Recovery Team Arrival
*Can occur during investigation or Prism approach*

#### Team Composition
**[[Captain Thane Goldspear]]** with:
- 6 [[Amunrai Desert Stat Blocks#Imperial Desert Soldiers|Imperial Desert Soldiers]] in contamination gear
- 1 [[Amunrai Desert Stat Blocks#Imperial Scout Mage|Imperial Scout Mage]] with temporal detection equipment
- Orders to "recover stolen Imperial research materials"

#### Imperial Response Options
- **Negotiation:** Claim Port Zephyr Council authority
- **Deception:** Convince them you're hunting thieves
- **Combat:** Fight while dealing with crystal hazards
- **Cooperation:** Work together to contain temporal threat

### Temporal Instability Escalation
As party spends time near Prism:
- **Minor:** Objects briefly age or restore themselves
- **Moderate:** Characters experience others' memories
- **Major:** Glimpses of alternate timeline outcomes
- **Critical:** Temporal storm builds for Act 3

### Ashira's Deteriorating Condition
- **Timeline Slippage:** Less anchored to current timeline
- **Information Urgency:** Critical details before losing coherence
- **Spreading Crystallization:** If Prism remains active
- **Final Warning:** Last coherent message about choice consequences

## Transition to Act 3

Escalation occurs as players gather information:
- **Imperial Pressure:** Forces demand artifact recovery
- **Temporal Instability:** Garden shows collapse or expansion signs
- **Critical Choice Point:** Conflicting demands require decision
- **Ashira's Revelation:** Explains true cost of temporal manipulation

## DM Guidance

### Managing Investigation
- **Layer revelations** - start simple, build complexity
- **Multiple discovery paths** - investigation, magic, conversation
- **Time pressure** from Imperial arrival and instability
- **Clear consequences** for different approach methods

### Ashira Roleplay
- **Temporal confusion** - responds to unasked questions
- **Tragic figure** - victim of temporal manipulation
- **Information source** - but increasingly unreliable
- **Moral weight** - her suffering shows cost of "solutions"

### Building to Choice
- Every discovery should make the decision harder
- No option should seem obviously correct
- Imperial pressure prevents careful deliberation
- Ashira's condition creates urgency
