## Initial Discovery
As the party crests a large dune, they find a haunting sight: five wagons half-buried in crystallized sand, surrounded by crystalline growths that pulse with an inner light. The air thrums with unstable magical energy, and delicate crystal formations extend outward from the caravan in a spiral pattern covering roughly 300 feet in diameter. At the center, a crystalline artifact—the Prism of Echoes—floats above a natural pedestal, casting shifting shadows that seem to show multiple moments in time simultaneously.

## The Caravan Site

### Exterior Investigation
- 5 wagons arranged in what was once a defensive circle
- 12 crystallized figures frozen in various poses of flight and protection
- Cargo scattered and partially crystallized, including broken containment boxes
- Crystal formations growing through and around the wagons in geometric patterns

### Investigation DCs and Discoveries
- **DC 12 Investigation:** Find evidence of magical containment failure—broken crystal-lined boxes that once held the Prism
- **DC 15 Arcana:** Recognize energy signatures combining temporal magic with Remnant contamination
- **DC 14 Perception:** Notice crystallized figures positioned as if fleeing toward the Prism, not away from it
- **DC 16 History:** Connect the energy patterns to theoretical descriptions of pre-Cataclysm temporal manipulation artifacts

### Advanced Investigation Results
- **DC 18 Arcana:** Detect that the crystallization occurred in multiple waves, suggesting repeated magical activation
- **DC 20 Investigation:** Find carved warnings in multiple languages about "temporal debt" and "borrowed time"
- **DC 17 Medicine:** Determine that crystallized figures are still alive—hearts beat once per minute, consciousness trapped

### Crystallized Figures
The caravan members are preserved in crystal but still conscious:
- **Merchant Captain:** Pointing toward broken containment boxes, mouth open in warning
- **Guard Sergeant:** Frozen mid-draw of sword, facing toward the crystal garden's heart
- **Caravan Healer:** Crystallized while attempting to tend to an injured companion
- **Pack Animals:** Horses and mules crystallized mid-panic, still showing fear in their eyes

#### Attempting Communication
- **Speak with Dead:** Works, but responses are fragmented and focus on temporal warnings
- **Physical Contact:** Touching crystallized figures causes psychic feedback (1d6 psychic damage, DC 15 Wisdom save or gain brief flashes of their memories)
- **Breaking Crystal:** Attempting to free them causes 3d6 psychic damage to both figure and rescuer

## The Crystal Garden

### Three Distinct Zones

#### Outer Ring (150-300ft from center)
- Scattered crystal formations up to 6 feet tall
- **Movement:** Normal speed, but DC 12 Dexterity saves to avoid crystal shards (1d6 piercing)
- **Magic:** Spells function normally
- **Contamination:** Mild exposure risk after 30 minutes

#### Middle Ring (50-150ft from center)  
- Dense crystal growth creating maze-like passages
- **Movement:** Speed reduced by half, DC 14 Dexterity saves every 30 feet (2d6 piercing + crystal entanglement)
- **Magic:** Spell reflection chance (roll d10: 1 reflects to random target)
- **Contamination:** Moderate exposure risk after 10 minutes
- **Navigation:** DC 15 Survival to find optimal path

#### Inner Sanctum (0-50ft from center)
- Perfect crystalline formations creating natural amphitheater
- **Movement:** Safe paths exist but require DC 16 Perception to identify
- **Magic:** Spells may have unpredictable effect. roll on the remnant table. (When does this trigger?)
- **Contamination:** Heavy exposure risk immediately
- **Temporal Effects:** Occasional glimpses of past/future events in crystal reflections

### The Heart of the Garden
**The Prism of Echoes** floats 5 feet above a crystalline pedestal at the garden's center:
- **Appearance:** Multifaceted crystal that shifts between transparent and opaque
- **Temporal Resonance:** Shows brief glimpses of different time periods in its facets
- **Energy Patterns:** Pulses in rhythm with heartbeats of crystallized figures
- **Protective Field:** DC 18 Arcana check to safely approach without triggering defenses

## Key Locations and Discoveries

### The Merchant's Wagon
- **Locked Strongbox:** Contains shipping manifest and payment records (DC 15 Thieves' Tools)
- **Imperial Documentation:** Orders to transport "Class VII Temporal Research Material"
- **Personal Journal:** Final entry warns about containment failure and "time debt coming due"
- **Hidden Compartment:** Emergency protocols for temporal artifact containment breach

### The Broken Containment System
- **Crystal-Lined Boxes:** Sophisticated Imperial magical technology
- **Containment Failure:** Evidence suggests intentional opening from inside, not external force
- **Temporal Stabilizers:** Magical components designed to prevent time displacement
- **Warning Inscriptions:** "TEMPORAL MANIPULATION ARTIFACT - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"

### Ashira's Crystalline Prison
**Ashira the Sandshaper** is found partially crystallized near the Prism:
- **Temporal Condition:** Exists across multiple timeline fragments simultaneously
- **Consciousness State:** Lucid but experiencing past, present, and future simultaneously
- **Physical State:** Lower body crystallized, upper body shifting between different ages
- **Communication:** Can speak but often responds to questions before they're asked

#### What Ashira Knows
- **Prism Function:** Creates healing by stealing equivalent life force from future timeline
- **Caravan Disaster:** Someone used the Prism to heal an injured companion, triggering cascade
- **Imperial Purpose:** Researchers plan to weaponize temporal debt principle against enemies
- **Temporal Cost:** Every use creates "debt" that manifests as suffering elsewhere/elsewhen
- **Containment Failure:** The artifact actively resists containment when it senses potential users

## Environmental Hazards and Defenses

### Crystal Shard Storms
- **Trigger:** Loud noises, magical explosions, or damage to major formations
- **Effect:** 2d6 piercing damage per round to creatures in affected area
- **Duration:** 3 rounds unless formation source is destroyed
- **Protection:** Cover behind intact crystal provides immunity

### Spell Reflection Matrix
- **Crystalline Surfaces:** 30% chance to reflect targeted spells
- **Reflection Rules:** Spell targets random creature within range
- **Prediction:** DC 15 Arcana check to predict reflection angle
- **Mitigation:** Area effect spells are less likely to reflect

### Temporal Echoes
- **Manifestation:** Brief glimpses of the same area at different time periods
- **Effect:** DC 14 Wisdom save or become stunned for 1 round by temporal disorientation
- **Information:** May reveal past events or hint at future consequences
- **Frequency:** Increases as party approaches the Prism

### Crystallization Spread
- **Progressive Effect:** Contamination levels increase while in the garden
- **Constitution Saves:** Required every 10 minutes in Inner Sanctum, 30 minutes in Middle Ring
- **Failed Saves:** Gain contamination levels, risk of crystallization at extreme levels
- **Reversal:** Moving away from center reduces progression rate

- **Temporal Anomalies:** Occasionally, attacks hit targets from previous rounds

## Approaching the Prism

### Three Potential Methods

#### 1. Force Approach
- **Combat Route:** Fight through crystal guardians
- **Hazards:** Face all environmental dangers while fighting
- **Time Cost:** Fastest route but highest risk
- **Consequences:** Destroys potential research value of formations

#### 2. Stealth and Skill
- **Navigation:** Series of Stealth, Acrobatics, and Survival checks
- **DC Progression:** 12, 14, 16 as party moves through rings
- **Advantages:** Avoid combat, preserve formations
- **Risks:** Failure triggers guardian response and environmental hazards

#### 3. Magical Manipulation
- **Arcana Challenges:** Use magic to safely navigate crystal maze
- **Spell Requirements:** Protective wards, magical sight, dispelling
- **Benefits:** Can gather more information about temporal effects
- **Costs:** High spell slot expenditure, risk of spell reflection

### Reaching the Prism Itself
Once at the garden's heart, players must decide how to interact with the artifact:
- **Direct Contact:** Triggers temporal visions and immediate understanding of its function
- **Magical Analysis:** Reveals the temporal debt mechanism without activation risk
- **Ashira's Guidance:** She can explain the artifact's true nature and consequences
- **Attempted Removal:** Causes crystal garden to react violently

## Complications and Timing

### Imperial Recovery Team Arrival
*Can occur during investigation or approach to Prism*

**Captain Thane Goldspear** arrives with:
- 6 Imperial soldiers in contamination gear
- 1 Imperial researcher with temporal detection equipment
- Orders to "recover stolen Imperial research materials"

#### Imperial Response Options
- **Negotiation:** Claim authority from Port Zephyr Council
- **Deception:** Convince them you're also hunting thieves
- **Combat:** Fight Imperial forces while dealing with crystal hazards
- **Cooperation:** Work together to contain the temporal threat

### Temporal Instability Increase
As party spends time near the Prism:
- **Minor Effects:** Objects briefly age or restore themselves
- **Moderate Effects:** Characters experience memories that aren't theirs
- **Major Effects:** Brief glimpses of alternate timeline outcomes
- **Critical Effects:** Temporal storm begins building for Part 3

### Ashira's Deteriorating Condition
- **Timeline Slippage:** She becomes less anchored to current timeline
- **Information Urgency:** Critical details must be obtained before she loses coherence
- **Temporal Decay:** Her crystallization begins spreading if Prism remains active
- **Final Warning:** Last coherent message about the choice consequences

## Transition to Part 3
As players gather information and make decisions about the Prism, the situation escalates:
- **Imperial Pressure:** Forces arrive demanding artifact recovery
- **Temporal Instability:** The garden begins showing signs of collapse or expansion
- **Critical Choice Point:** Players must decide between conflicting demands
- **Ashira's Final Revelation:** She explains the true cost of temporal manipulation

The crystallized caravan serves as a warning of what happens when temporal magic goes wrong, while the Prism itself represents both potential salvation and damnation—the perfect embodiment of the setting's theme that magical solutions always come with hidden costs.
