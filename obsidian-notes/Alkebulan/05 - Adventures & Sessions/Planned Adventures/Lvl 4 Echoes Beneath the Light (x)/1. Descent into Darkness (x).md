- Players navigate a trap-filled stairway leading to the temple entrance.
- Encounter: Animated statues (reflavored Stone Cursed)(4?) guarding the entrance.
- Puzzle: A mosaic floor puzzle that, when solved, safely opens the main temple doors.

The Mosaic Floor Puzzle: "The Cycle of Tides"

Description:
As the players enter the antechamber, they see a large circular mosaic on the floor, about 20 feet in diameter. The mosaic depicts various phases of the moon, ocean waves, and sea creatures arranged in concentric circles. The outer edge of the mosaic contains 8 stone buttons, each marked with a different symbol.

Puzzle Mechanics:
1. The mosaic is divided into four concentric rings, each able to rotate independently.
2. Each ring represents a different aspect: Moon phases, Tides, Sea Creatures, and Wind directions.
3. Players must align the rings correctly to match the current state of nature above.

Solution Steps:
1. Observe the current moon phase and tide state (provide this information based on the in-game time).
2. Rotate the outer ring to match the current moon phase.
3. Align the second ring (tides) to match the appropriate tide for that moon phase.
4. The third ring (sea creatures) must be aligned to match the tide (e.g., deep-sea creatures with high tide).
5. The innermost ring (wind directions) should align with the prevailing winds of the season.

Clues:
- A riddle inscribed on the wall: "As above, so below. The dance of moon and sea, in stone and light, shall open the way."
- Arcana checks can reveal magical resonances between the mosaic and the lighthouse above.
- History checks might recall local sailors' lore about tides and moon phases.

Interaction:
- Players can use the stone buttons to rotate each ring.
- Each correct alignment causes a soft blue glow in that ring.
- When all rings are correctly aligned, the entire mosaic glows brightly, and the temple doors swing open.

Variations:
- For added challenge, include a time element where the solution changes every few minutes, mimicking the actual tides.
- Allow creative solutions using spells like Control Water or Create or Destroy Water to influence the puzzle.
