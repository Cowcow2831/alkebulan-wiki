The Tone Sequence Puzzle: "The Lighthouse's Song"

Setting:
The Resonance Hall is a large, domed chamber with smooth walls that seem to shimmer. In the center stands a circular arrangement of seven crystal pillars, each a different color of the rainbow. The room is filled with a soft, ambient hum.

Puzzle Mechanics:
1. Each crystal pillar emits a different musical tone when touched.
2. Players must play the correct sequence of tones to unlock the next chamber.
3. The correct sequence mimics the light patterns of the Sapphire Lighthouse.

Components:
- Seven crystal pillars: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet
- A mural on the wall depicting the Sapphire Lighthouse with its beam sweeping across the sky
- Small crystals embedded in the floor that light up in response to the correct tones

Solution:
The correct sequence is based on the lighthouse's signal pattern: Blue, Indigo, Blue, Violet, Green, Blue

Clues:
1. The mural shows the lighthouse beam in different colors, hinting at the sequence.
2. An inscription reads: "The guardian's song echoes in crystal and light. Match its rhythm to reveal the path."
3. Successful History or Arcana checks can reveal information about the lighthouse's signal patterns.

Interaction:
- Players can touch or strike the crystals to produce tones.
- Each correct tone in the sequence causes a corresponding floor crystal to light up.
- Playing the full correct sequence opens the door to the next chamber.
