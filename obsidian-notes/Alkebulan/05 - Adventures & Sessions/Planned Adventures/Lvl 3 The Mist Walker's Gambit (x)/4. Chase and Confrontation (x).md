1. Initiating the Chase:
   - Whisper successfully grabs the artifact and attempts to flee.
   - Give players a brief moment to react and decide how to pursue.

2. Urban Terrain:
   - Utilize Port Zephyr's diverse urban landscape:
     - Crowded marketplaces
     - Narrow alleyways
     - Rooftops
     - Docks or canal areas

3. Skill Challenges:
   - Incorporate a series of skill checks to represent the chase:
     - Athletics for climbing or jumping
     - Acrobatics for balance or dodging obstacles
     - Perception to keep track of Whisper
     - Intelligence to predict her route or take shortcuts

4. Obstacles and Complications:
   - Add dynamic elements to the chase:
     - Crowds of people to navigate
     - Carts or stalls to jump over
     - City Watch patrols to avoid or interact with
     - Environmental hazards like slippery roofs or unstable scaffolding

5. Whisper's Abilities:
   - Have Whisper use her Mistwalker abilities creatively:
     - Mist Form to slip through tight spaces
     - Mistborn Illusion to create diversions
     - Cunning Action to Dash or Hide

6. Splitting the Party:
   - Encourage players to split up and coordinate to cut off Whisper's escape routes.
   - This can create interesting tactical decisions and parallel action.

7. NPC Involvement:
   - Introduce helpful or hindering NPCs during the chase:
     - City Watch getting involved
     - Mist Walker allies coming to Whisper's aid
     - Curious onlookers or angry merchants whose wares get damaged

8. Decision Points:
   - Present players with quick decisions that affect the chase:
     - Take a risky shortcut or stick to a safer, longer route
     - Stop to help a bystander in danger or stay focused on the pursuit
     - Attempt to reason with or intimidate Whisper mid-chase

9. Confrontation Setup:
   - The chase should culminate in a final confrontation location:
     - A dead-end alley
     - An abandoned warehouse
     - A public square
     - The docks, with nowhere left to run

10. Final Showdown:
    - Whisper, cornered, might attempt to negotiate or fight her way out.
    - This is where combat might break out if it hasn't already.
    - Use the environment for dynamic combat possibilities.

11. Moral Dilemma:
    - Introduce a twist that complicates the players' decision:
     - Whisper reveals a noble motive for the theft
     - The artifact shows signs of being dangerous if mishandled
     - A third party intervenes with their own agenda

12. Resolution:
    - Allow multiple possible outcomes based on player actions:
     - Whisper's capture or escape
     - Retrieval or loss of the artifact
     - Potential alliances formed or broken

13. Consequences:
    - The outcome of the chase and confrontation should have clear impacts:
     - On the players' reputation in Port Zephyr
     - On their relationship with various factions (City Watch, Mist Walkers, Azira)
     - Setting up future plot hooks based on their decisions

Remember to keep the pace fast and exciting during the chase, using quick descriptions and rapid-fire skill checks. The confrontation should feel tense and meaningful, with the players' earlier actions and decisions playing a significant role in how it unfolds.
