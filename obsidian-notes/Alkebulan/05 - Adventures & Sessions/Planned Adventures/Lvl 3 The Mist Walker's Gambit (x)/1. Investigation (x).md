1. Initial Briefing:
   - Azira Goldweave provides basic information about the threat and the upcoming soiree.
   - She shows players the taunting note, which could contain cryptic clues.

2. Exploring the Villa:
   - Allow players to investigate different areas of the villa:
     a) The study where the artifact is kept
     b) Servant quarters
     c) Gardens and grounds
     d) Main hall where the soiree will take place

3. Investigation Methods:
   - Perception checks to notice unusual details or hidden passages
   - Investigation checks to analyze clues or security measures
   - Insight checks when interviewing staff or guests

4. Key Clues to Plant:
   - Traces of mist in unlikely places (hinting at Mistwalker involvement)
   - A dropped thieves' tool with an unusual design
   - Whispered conversations among staff about strange occurrences

5. NPC Interactions:
   - Interview staff members, each with different levels of knowledge or suspicion
   - Encounter early-arriving guests who might have noticed something

6. Skill Challenges:
   - Social encounters to gain trust of suspicious staff
   - Stealth challenges to access restricted areas
   - Arcana checks to identify any magical security measures

7. Red Herrings:
   - Include a few false leads to make the investigation more challenging
   - Perhaps a staff member acting suspiciously for unrelated reasons

8. Timeline Pressure:
   - Stress that the soiree is approaching, forcing players to prioritize their investigation

9. Branching Paths:
   - Allow different approaches to yield different but equally valuable information
   - Reward creative thinking and use of class abilities

10. Information Synthesis:
    - Encourage players to piece together clues to predict the method and timing of the heist

11. Preparation Opportunities:
    - Based on their findings, allow players to make preparations for the soiree
    - This could include setting traps, reinforcing security, or planning their own positions

12. Faction Involvement:
    - Hints of City Watch involvement or skepticism
    - Subtle signs of other interested parties (potential Remnant Keeper agents)

By structuring the investigation this way, you create a dynamic and engaging experience that allows players to approach the problem from multiple angles. Their successes (or failures) during this phase can directly impact how prepared they are for the heist itself, adding weight to their choices and methods.
