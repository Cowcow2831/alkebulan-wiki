Adventure: "The Mist Walker's Gambit"

Setting: The Merchant's Quarter of Port Zephyr, focusing on a wealthy merchant's villa and the surrounding area.

Hook: The players are approached by a flustered merchant named Azira Goldweave, who believes her prized possession - a small, ornate box said to contain a powerful good luck charm - is about to be stolen. She's received a taunting note claiming the theft will occur during her upcoming soiree.

Key NPCs:
1. Azira Goldweave - The worried merchant
2. [[Whisper (x)]] - A skilled Mistwalker thief
3. Captain Thorne - A member of the City Watch, skeptical of Azira's claims
4. Various party guests, including potential suspects and unwitting accomplices

Adventure Outline:

1. [[1. Investigation (x)]]:
   - Players can investigate the villa, interview staff, and gather information about the upcoming party.
   - Clever players might uncover clues about the Mist Walkers' involvement.

2. [[2. The Soiree (x)]]:
   - Players attend the party, either openly as guards or undercover as guests.
   - They must navigate social interactions while staying alert for the thief.

3. [[3. The Heist (x)]]:
   - Whisper attempts to steal the box using a combination of stealth, illusion, and misdirection.
   - Players can attempt to stop the theft, aid it unknowingly, or even assist if they've been swayed to the Mist Walkers' side.

4. [[4. Chase and Confrontation (x)]]:
   - If Whisper succeeds in taking the box, a chase through the Merchant's Quarter ensues.
