Heist Outline:

1. Initial Distraction:
   - Whisper could use her Mistborn Illusion to create a diversion (e.g., illusory fire or a "dropped" valuable).
   - If players didn't secure all entry points, she might have an accomplice cause a distraction.

2. Infiltration:
   - Whisper uses her Mist Form to slip through cracks or under doors.
   - If players didn't discover hidden passages, she might use these for easier access.

3. Security Measures:
   - Players' preparations come into play here. Well-placed guards or magical alarms could hinder Whisper.
   - Poor preparation might allow her to move more freely.

4. The Theft:
   - Whisper attempts to swap the artifact with a fake using Sleight of Hand.
   - If players are vigilant, they might notice the switch with successful Perception checks.

5. Escape Attempt:
   - Whisper tries to leave quietly, using Stealth and her Mist Form ability if necessary.
   - Players' positioning and awareness are crucial here.

Escalation to Combat:

If the players have performed poorly in the investigation or Whisper is cornered, the situation could escalate to combat. Here's how it might unfold:

1. Initial Confrontation:
   - Whisper is spotted or cornered, leading to a tense standoff.
   - She might try to bluff her way out using Deception.

2. Combat Initiation:
   - If bluffing fails, Whisper could use her Hand Crossbow to create distance.
   - She'll prioritize escape over prolonged fighting.

3. Dynamic Environment:
   - Use the villa's layout for an interesting battleground (stairs, balconies, tight corridors).
   - Whisper might knock over furniture or use her Mistborn Illusion to create obstacles.

4. Mistwalker Tactics:
   - Whisper uses Cunning Action to Disengage or Hide frequently.
   - She'll use Mist Form to escape through small openings if severely pressured.

5. Sneak Attack Opportunities:
   - If Whisper can hide successfully, she'll try to land Sneak Attacks.
   - This encourages players to stay alert and work together.

6. NPC Involvement:
   - Party guests might become obstacles or collateral damage.
   - City Watch could arrive, complicating the situation.

7. Escape Routes:
   - Prepare multiple potential escape routes for Whisper.
   - Players' earlier actions might have blocked some of these.

8. Artifact Risk:
   - Whisper might threaten to destroy the artifact if cornered.
   - This presents a moral dilemma for the players.

9. Reinforcements:
   - If the players are overwhelming Whisper, she might have backup arrive (use weaker stat blocks like Bandits).

10. Resolution:
    - The encounter could end with Whisper's capture, escape, or a negotiation.
    - The outcome should depend heavily on the players' actions and decisions.

Remember, Whisper's primary goal is to obtain the artifact and escape, not to engage in prolonged combat. The potential for combat adds tension and consequences to the players' earlier investigative efforts, making their choices throughout the adventure more impactful.
