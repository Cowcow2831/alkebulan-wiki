Entrance Description:
As the obsidian doors swing open, a rush of stale air escapes. Before you stretches a long, dark corridor lined with shimmering black walls that seem to absorb light. Faint, pulsing lines of energy run along the floor, leading deeper into the mountain.

Chamber 1: The Temporal Nexus

Description:
You enter a vast, circular room where reality itself seems to waver. Ghostly images of the past and future flicker in and out of existence. In the center, a large temporal anchor pulses with energy, surrounded by three pedestals.

Challenge: Players must synchronize their actions across different time phases to progress.

Mechanics:
1. The room cycles through past, present, and future every round.
2. Each pedestal requires a specific action (like placing a relic or channeling magic) in a specific time phase.
3. Players can only interact with objects from their current time phase.
4. Temporal echoes of the players' future selves provide cryptic clues.

Puzzle Solution:
- Correctly time actions on all three pedestals within 5 rounds.
- Requires coordination and possibly splitting the party across different time phases.

Setting up the Temporal Nexus:

1. Prepare three index cards labeled "Past," "Present," and "Future."
2. Have a timer or way to track rounds.
3. Create a simple diagram of the room showing the central anchor and three pedestals.

Running the Chamber:

1. Explain the Scene:
   - Describe the room, emphasizing the flickering temporal images and the central anchor with three pedestals.
   - Explain that time is unstable here, shifting between past, present, and future.

2. Time Phase Mechanics:
   - At the start of each round, flip to the next time phase card (Past → Present → Future → Past).
   - Explain that players can only interact with objects that exist in the current time phase.

3. The Puzzle Goal:
   - Players need to activate all three pedestals in the correct time phases within 5 rounds.
   - Each pedestal requires a specific action in a specific time phase.

4. Pedestal Actions (example):
   - Pedestal 1: Place a relic (found in the room) in the Past
   - Pedestal 2: Channel magic into it in the Present
   - Pedestal 3: Recite a specific incantation in the Future

5. Clues and Information:
   - In each phase, describe what players see differently:
     - Past: The room looks newer, pedestals are empty
     - Present: Current state, signs of age
     - Future: Room looks ancient, may see results of their actions

   - Future echoes of the players can give hints like:
     "Remember, the relic goes in the past!" or "The second pedestal activates now!"

6. Running Each Round:
   - Announce the current time phase
   - Ask each player what they want to do
   - Resolve actions, describing the effects
   - If a correct action is taken, that pedestal activates (visually or audibly)

7. Challenges:
   - If players linger too long, call for Constitution saves to avoid temporal effects
   - Use these effects to add urgency, not to punish (e.g., hair changing color, brief age shifts)

8. Resolution:
   - If all pedestals are activated within 5 rounds, describe the temporal energies stabilizing
   - If they fail, reset the puzzle but allow them to keep knowledge gained

Tips for Running:
- Keep the pace brisk to maintain tension
- Encourage players to discuss and plan between rounds
- Be flexible with creative solutions that fit the puzzle's logic
- Use vivid descriptions to emphasize the shifting time phases

By running the chamber this way, you create a dynamic, cooperative puzzle that challenges players to think in terms of cause and effect across time, while maintaining an exciting and slightly chaotic atmosphere.

Chamber 2: The Remnant Crucible

Description:
This chamber thrums with barely contained magical energy. In the center, a swirling vortex of pure remnant magic is held in check by ancient wards. Surrounding it are various magical apparatus and control mechanisms.

Challenge: Disarm a deadly remnant magic trap while managing unstable energy flows.

Mechanics:
1. The vortex periodically (1-3 rounds depending on how many "locks" are pointed in) releases bursts of wild magic (use your wild magic table).
2. Players must redirect energy flows using the ancient mechanisms Point them all at the center (Arcana checks).
3. Overloading or underloading any part of the system triggers dangerous magical reactions.

Puzzle Solution:
- Balance the energy flow across all systems.
- Requires a combination of Arcana knowledge, quick thinking, and possibly creative use of spells or abilities.

Transition to Final Chamber:
Upon successfully navigating both chambers, a hidden door reveals itself, leading to the Heart of the Vault where the Nexus Shard awaits.
