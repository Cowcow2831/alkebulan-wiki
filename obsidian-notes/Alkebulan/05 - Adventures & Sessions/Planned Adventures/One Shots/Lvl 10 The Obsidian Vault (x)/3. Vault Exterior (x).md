Descriptive Text:
As you approach the mountain face, the entrance to the Obsidian Vault comes into full view. A massive obsidian arch, easily 30 feet tall, is set into the mountainside. Strange, glowing runes pulse along its surface in a hypnotic rhythm. The area before the entrance has been turned into a makeshift camp by the Amunrai forces. Tents, magical wards, and patrolling guards create a formidable barrier between you and your goal. To the side of the arch, a complex array of crystals is arranged in a semi-circle, clearly part of the locking mechanism.

Stealth Mission:

Objective: Bypass or neutralize the Amunrai guards without raising an alarm.

Layout:
- 6-8 guard patrols, each with 2 soldiers
- 3 mages monitoring magical detection wards
- 1 command tent with [[Commander Sunspear (x)]] and 2 elite guards
- Magical alarm wards at key points

Challenges:
1. Timed Patrols: Guards move in predictable patterns, requiring careful timing.
2. Magical Detection: Areas covered by wards require a DC 15 Stealth check to bypass.
3. Distraction Options: Environmental features (loose rocks, wildlife) can be used to create diversions.
4. Neutralization: Subduing guards silently (DC 14 Athletics to grapple or DC 16 sleight of hand to use sleep darts).

Crystal Puzzle to Unlock the Vault:

The Mechanism:
- 7 crystals of different colors arranged in a semi-circle
- The correct alignment will unlock the vault door
- ROYGBIV is the solve
- Start in GYBIOVR

Puzzle Elements:
1. Color Sequence: The crystals must be aligned in a specific color order. Rainbow
2. Runes on the ground depicting rain and light motifs
3. Remnant Magic Attunement: Players must channel small amounts of magic (spell slots or ability checks) into the correct crystals.

Solving the Puzzle:
- Clues to the correct sequence are hidden in the runes along the obsidian arch.
- An Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10 check reveals the runic pattern.
- A successful Intelligence (Arcana) DC 14 check provides intuition about the magical flow between crystals.

Success:
When solved, the crystals resonate in harmony, and the obsidian doors slowly swing open, revealing the dark passage into the vault itself.
