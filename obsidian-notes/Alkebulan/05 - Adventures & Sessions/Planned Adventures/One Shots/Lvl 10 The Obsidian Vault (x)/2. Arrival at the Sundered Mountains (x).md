As you crest the final hill, the Sundered Mountains loom before you, their jagged peaks seeming to pierce the very sky. But what truly catches your eye is the impossible scene between you and the mountains proper. Dozens of massive boulders and rock platforms hang suspended in the air, creating a treacherous, ever-shifting pathway across a vast chasm. The rocks sway gently, some rotating slowly, others bobbing up and down as if breathing. Wisps of luminous, remnant magic swirl around them, testament to the powerful forces at work.

In the distance, you can make out the dark maw of the vault entrance set into the mountainside. Between you and your goal lies this daunting aerial obstacle course. The magical map provided by Shadowwhisper glows faintly, revealing a suggested path through the floating maze â€“ but it's clear that the rocks have shifted since the map was created.

As you watch, a boulder the size of a house suddenly plummets into the misty depths below, only to be replaced moments later by another rising from the chasm. The air thrums with arcane energy, and you can feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. This, you realize, is your first true test as Remnant Keepers.

Encounter Details:

The Floating Rock Field:
- Spans approximately 300 feet from the edge of the cliff to the vault entrance.
- Consists of 20-30 floating rock platforms of various sizes.
- Platforms move in set patterns, but some may fall or rise unexpectedly.

Challenge:
Players must navigate across the floating rocks to reach the vault entrance. This requires a combination of athletic skills, magical aptitude, and quick thinking.

Mechanics:
1. Movement: Players can move between adjacent platforms with a DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics check.
2. Unstable Platforms: Some rocks require a DC 15 Dexterity save to remain balanced after landing.
3. Gaps: Larger gaps might require magical assistance (like Jump spell) or creative use of equipment.
4. Falling Rocks: At the start of each round, there's a 2-in-6 chance a random platform falls or rises sharply.
5. Remnant Magic: Players can attempt to manipulate the remnant magic (DC 15 Arcana check) to stabilize platforms or create temporary magical bridges.

Complications:
- Strong, unpredictable winds that can push characters off course (DC 14 Strength save to resist).
- A pair of young wyverns circling the area, occasionally swooping in to attack.
- Unstable remnant magic causing random magical effects (use your wild magic table).

Success:
Upon reaching the other side, players reach the Vault Entrance
