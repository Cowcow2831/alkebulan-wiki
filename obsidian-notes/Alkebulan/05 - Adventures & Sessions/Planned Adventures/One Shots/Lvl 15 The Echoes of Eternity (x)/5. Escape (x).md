1. Immediate Aftermath:
   - Based on the party's decision, describe the rapid destabilization of the Cradle:
     - If destroyed: Massive explosions of remnant energy, reality fracturing.
     - If secured: Surges of power causing structural damage as the Engine is contained.
     - If allied with Imperium: Chaotic energy as the Engine is hastily extracted.

2. Structural Collapse:
   - The Cradle begins to break apart. Describe huge chunks of the structure falling away into the sky.
   - Gravity becomes erratic, alternating between crushing force and zero-g conditions.

3. Evacuation Route Challenges:
   - The path the party used to enter is now blocked, forcing them to find an alternative escape route.
   - Skill Challenge: Use Athletics, Acrobatics, and creative spell use to navigate collapsing corridors and platforms.

4. Time Distortions:
   - The destabilizing Eternity Engine causes temporal anomalies throughout the Cradle.
   - In some areas, time moves slower or faster, requiring careful coordination to progress together.

5. Remnant Energy Surges:
   - Waves of pure remnant energy sweep through the Cradle, causing random magical effects.
   - This could temporarily enhance or negate the party's magical abilities, adding an element of unpredictability to their escape.

6. Pursuit or Cooperation:
   - Depending on earlier choices, the party might be:
     - Pursued by remaining Imperium forces
     - Racing against Solaris Vex to escape
     - Cooperating with Imperium survivors to find a way out

7. The Skyship Hangar:
   - The party discovers an ancient skyship hangar, offering a potential means of escape.
   - Challenge: Quickly repair and activate a long-dormant skyship while the hangar crumbles around them.

8. Final Obstacle - The Seal:
   - As they attempt to fly the skyship out, they find the Cradle's main doors sealed by ancient magic.
   - Final Puzzle: Quickly decipher and dispel the seal while dodging falling debris and energy surges.

9. The Breakout:
   - A cinematic moment as the skyship bursts from the disintegrating Cradle.
   - Piloting Challenge: Navigate through a field of floating debris and volatile remnant energy clouds.

10. The Shockwave:
    - Just as they think they're clear, a massive shockwave from the Cradle's final collapse threatens to overwhelm them.
    - Final Skill Challenge: Work together to outrun or defend against the shockwave.

11. Aftermath and View:
    - As they escape, give the party a moment to witness the awe-inspiring and terrifying sight of Zephyr's Cradle collapsing into itself, creating a spectacle of remnant energy visible for miles.

12. Escape Options:
    - Depending on their success and choices, the party might:
      - Successfully escape on the skyship
      - Need to be rescued by Captain Thorne at the last second
      - Use emergency teleportation scrolls provided by Azara as a last resort

13. Conclusion:
    - Once they're safe, allow a moment for the party to reflect on their adventure and its consequences for Alkebulan.
    - Perhaps end with a brief epilogue hinting at the wider impact of their actions.

Throughout this escape sequence, maintain a high-energy, fast-paced narrative. Quickly move from one challenge to the next, keeping the pressure on the players to think fast and act decisively. This final part should feel like a breathless race against time, with the very real possibility of failure adding tension to every moment. The escape serves as an exciting capstone to the adventure, testing all the skills and teamwork the party has developed along the way.
