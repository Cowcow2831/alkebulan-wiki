1. The Eternity Engine Chamber:
   - As the party enters, describe the awe-inspiring sight: a massive spherical chamber with the Eternity Engine at its center - a swirling vortex of pure, crystalline remnant energy suspended in mid-air.
   - Platforms at various levels surround the Engine, connected by bridges of solidified magic.
   - The air crackles with power, causing minor magical effects around the party.

2. Arrival of the Imperium:
   - Just as the party takes in the scene, the opposing door bursts open.
   - Enter Solaris Vex, the Sunchild mage, flanked by elite Imperium guards and artificers.
   - Tense standoff as both groups realize they've arrived simultaneously.

3. Negotiation/Confrontation:
   - Solaris Vex attempts to persuade the party to step aside, promising rewards or threatening consequences.
   - This is a chance for roleplay and possibly a high-stakes Charisma (Persuasion) contest.
   - Depending on the party's choices, this could lead to combat or a temporary alliance to deal with a greater threat.

4. The Engine Awakens:
   - The presence of powerful individuals triggers the Eternity Engine fully.
   - The chamber begins to shift, platforms moving, gravity fluctuating, and bursts of temporal energy warping the space around them.

5. Boss Fight - Solaris Vex:
   - If combat ensues, Solaris proves to be a formidable opponent, using a combination of sun-based magic and remnant-infused abilities.
   - Solaris can manipulate the environment, using the Engine's energy to create hazards or advantages.
   - The fight should be dynamic, with the shifting platforms and gravity requiring constant adaptation.

6. Waves of Reinforcements:
   - Throughout the fight, waves of Imperium forces or awakened Cradle defenses join the fray, adding complexity to the encounter.
   - This could include elite guards, remnant-infused constructs, or even a smaller corrupted Skywhale that breaches the chamber wall.

7. The Engine's Instability:
   - As the battle progresses, the Eternity Engine becomes increasingly unstable.
   - Describe surges of energy, time distortions, and the fabric of reality starting to warp around the chamber.

8. Crucial Decision Point:
   - With Solaris defeated or at least at bay, the party faces their critical choice:
     a) Attempt to destroy the Engine to prevent its misuse.
     b) Try to stabilize and secure it for the Remnant Keepers.
     c) Consider Solaris's perspective and potentially ally with the Imperium.
   - Each choice should have clear consequences for the world of Alkebulan.

9. Race Against Time:
   - Whatever the party decides, they must act quickly as the Engine's instability reaches critical levels.
   - This could involve a skill challenge to destroy key points, a complex arcane ritual to contain the energy, or a desperate attempt to extract crucial components.

10. Consequences and Escape:
    - The party's actions have immediate effects - describe reality warping, massive surges of remnant energy, or the beginning of the Cradle's collapse.
    - They now face the urgent need to escape, setting up the final part of the adventure.

Throughout this section, emphasize the scale and power involved. The Eternity Engine should feel like it could reshape reality itself. The battle should be cinematic, with dynamic environmental changes and high stakes. The final choice should feel weighty, with the potential to significantly impact the future of Alkebulan.
